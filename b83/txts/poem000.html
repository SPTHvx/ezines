I See Your Picture
//////////////////
by: alcopaul

Enclosed in borders
Printed in paper
The face that makes me say
“I wish I see that everyday”
It’s in color
And I notice your features
Your skin tone is perfect
The color of your lips is perfect
Your smile is perfect
Even with those braces
Your eyes, yes, your eyes
Your baggy eyes surely tantalize
In the back, I see your address
 

You make me think of the next step
But if I ask you, will you gladly accept?
You will surely think that everything’s so fast
And you’re afraid that maybe it won’t last


I see your picture
I see your picture
On my wall
On my wall
