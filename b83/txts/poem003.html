//////////////////////
Darkness Led Me To You
//////////////////////
by: alcopaul

The night
Darkness filled with little lights
The moon and stars told me
About you
And your whereabouts


They said you command demons
That rip out the hearts of men
But I was not afraid
I was determined to carry through
I wanted to find you


Now that I found you
I implore you to make an
Eternal slave out of me
I deserve this
I deserve this


If you’re wondering what
Brought me here
It was darkness, yes
Darkness led me to you
