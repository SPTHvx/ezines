Waiting, Thankful
/////////////////

The imperfections in me
I thought they were meant
‘Cause You didn’t want me
To fly high
You wanted my feet to
Touch the ground
 

The trials that I went through
I thought that they were from You
‘Cause You wanted me
Not to fly high
You wanted my feet to
Touch the ground


My downfall, I enjoyed
The current state that I’m in, I savor
I thank You
Yes, like Job, I am thankful for all that
I’ve gone through, even they caused me pain and sorrow
I’m not hoping for a bright tomorrow
I’m not planning to have a comeback
Because I believe that I’ll be in Your refuge, soon
Just counting the seconds, just waiting for the day to finally expire.
