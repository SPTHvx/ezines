////////////////
A Date With Mara
////////////////
by: alcopaul

I now hold the fire
But she wants me to extinguish it
No, no, no, no
Yes, a date with Mara


I achieved enlightenment
But she wants me to be in the dark again
No, no, no, no
Yes, a date with Mara


I am at peace at last
But she opens the wounds of my past
No, no, no, no
Yes, a date with Mara


I found love and am in love
But she puts hatred in my heart
No, no, no, no
Yes, a date with Mara


I accepted death as my destiny
But she puts fear in me
No, no, no, no
Yes, a date with Mara


No, no, no, no
Yes, a date with Mara
