Paramita

I know what’s behind the sun
I know how dreams are made
I know where the holy grail is
I know what will I be after death


I’ve been there
And will be there
When I close my eyes.


The formula of the philosopher’s stone,
The building blocks of subatomic particles,
The recipe of true love,
The nature of energy,
They were all whispered to me


I’ve been there
And again will be there
After I close my eyes.


Do you want me to take you
To the other side?
