                                                but an advanced generator of

                                                as an addition to viruses.

                                                Uses Int 25h and Int 26h
                                                to Open, Read and Write to
                                                the file, using the same
                                                methods as the file engine
                                                in TBScan.

  Ph33r                         -       Author: Qark

                                        Group:  VLAD
                                        Type:   TSR infector of COM, EXE
                                                and Windows executables.
                                                Disables Vsafe in memory.
                                                Finds the original segment
                                                of int 21h and will use that
                                                instead.  When an infected
                                                windows executable is run
                                                from inside windows, the
                                                virus will go resident
                                                directly and infect any of
                                                com/exe or winexe when they
                                                are manipulated.  This makes
                                                it the only virus which runs
                                                under two environments.

                                                It uses PMEW to create
                                                a unique decryptor for
                                                each infection.

                                                executables.  Uses many
                                                retro structures.  Tunnels
                                                Int 21h using ART 2.1 (from
                                                VLAD-#3).  Encrypts the entire
                                                body of the infected host file
                                                so is very difficult to write
                                                a cleaner for.

                                                noteable for its incredibly
                                                small size, only taking 168
                                                bytes.

                                        Type:   Full stealth, parasitic TSR 
                                                infector of COM/EXE/XTP files.
                                                If present, the virus will
                                                go resident in UMB memory.
                                                The virus is polymorphic so
                                                will not be detectable using
                                                simple signature scanning.
                                                Will modify the DOS MCB
                                                structure when certain programs
                                                are run to hide it's presence
                                                in memory.  Contains some
                                                retro structures.

                                                infector of COM executables.
                                                The virus tunnels int 21h
                                                to find the original address
                                                thus bypassing some AV TSRs.
                                                If present, the virus will
                                                go resident in UMB memory.
                                                Infected files will show
                                                no change in filesize when
                                                the virus is resident.

                                                It creates two decryptors,

                                                second.
