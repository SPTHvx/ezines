        AAieeee. I'm sick to death of looking at this code any longer!


I could not test this 100%, coz my machine had an incompatibility i think.
and it only shows up when i infect SOME .exe files.  What happens is that
the file is infected properly, its header is updated, so is the memory
requirements, and the stack.  Now, it makes no difference if the virus
is in memory or not, but MSDos will load all the file into memory, except
for the last 512bytes or so, so everything gets decrypted, but because
the heap is at the end, its missing, along with some of the code.....
This is through no fault of mine, because the code is sound, so.....

    Poly \ Encryption : Lady Deaths Cosmetic Kit ð;)
                        Polymorph routines will generate a decryption routine
                        somewhere in the range of about 30 bytes to 64 bytes,
                        Will encrypt files with ADD, SUB, XOR, (NOT+NEG rmoved)

                        Lady Death's cosmetic kit,
                        Yes, it changes the face of your virus, takes those
                        unencrypted wrinkles out of your life, Lady Death's
                        cosmetic kit works wonders on memory resident .COM
                        and .EXE infectors, making them look more complex
                        than they really are, we here at [NuKE] will garuntee
                        that your virus will have that "just encrypted" look
                        that every young encrypted virus has, or we'll give
                        you your un-encrypted virus back, free of charge.

                        The polymorphic routines generate a variable length
                        decryptor, so the virus must be padded between the
                        end of the virus and the copy of the original
                        un-altered header to create a constant length I can
                        stealth.

                        After reading the documentation for TBAV [WTF! READ
                        documentaion! shya ;)] I liked the part where it tells
                        of creating a scan string for Malaga or something (one
                        of the encrypted Jerusalem variants) and about how it
                        only used two different CondJump opcodes, wich helped
                        give it away. So after some thinking, I managed to
                        implement 6 different ones, a step up from the standard
                        two ;), so thats 12 diff loops (up+down) in total!

                        The poly is the lamest routine in here, but I was
                        despairing over the size of her.... so had to be
                        cheap and cut back somewhere!

                        I originally had the virus completley polymorphing the
                        WHOLE file (in chunks), this put a major slowdown,
                        because, while avoiding memory scanners, it would
                        decrypt Int21h EVERY SINGLE TIME it was called, now
                        this is the most overused INT ever, its called more
                        times than the bloody clock per second, and it also
                        put an overhead of like 64 bytes of decryption per
                        chunk, so basically it is not really feasible.

                 Size : Poly (Max 64) + Virus Size + Padding + Header (018h)
                        2774 bytes infected

                        site and leech a copy of A86.
                         People with a lesser version of A86 can just leech a
                        new version.
                         People who are using CHASM can just fuck off.

         Side Effects : Hmm, well, i used the 6th bit (starting from 0)
                        to mark an infection, as far as i could tell, its the
                        only bit that is not used as Novel use the last bit
                        (7) for some network execution status thingy.
                        The FCB stealth routine, well, because non extended
                        FCB's dont include the attrib field, we can't test for
                        an infection, but how many programs use standard FCB's?
                        It does not check to see how small a file is before
                        infecting it, so it will infect files 0 bytes long.

                Notes : This virus changes its behaviour on the fly
                        depending on what program or function is being
                        run as to what mode it will enter.
                        Programs such as SCAN\PKZip,ARJ, etc will make
                        the virus go into FastInfection mode which will infect
                        any file opened with 3D\6C, while programs like
                        Scandisk, Chkdsk, or NortonDiskDoctor  make the virus
                        turn all its stealthing modes off, etc, etc.
                        Minimum memory required by the program is also
                        adjusted for .EXE files

; Some notes about the tunneling routine.
;
; The tunneling routine is designed to tunnel right up to the DOS
; Kernal, unlike some other tunnelers, it does not stop when it
; encounters the
;      NOP
;      NOP
;      CALL xxxx
;  CS: JMP D[xxxx]
;
; Dos POINTER to the kernal.   Its also able to find the kernal whether DOS
; is loaded LOW or HIGH, with EMM386 etc, etc, blah, QEMM, etc, blah, nuff!
;
; It also stops other programs from turning off the TRACE bit in the FLAGS
; register by detecting a POPF and OR'ing the flag bit to on.
;
; Some programs like TBDriver dont tolerate Int1 tracers, but i've added
; code that detected TBDriver, and bypasses it.
;
; The reason why TBdriver can detect Int1 tracers, is because TBDriver
; takes a word out of memory just below the stack pointer, now, if no
; Int1 tracer has been used, then the word is correct, but if Int1 is running
; then the word is overwritten in memory by the  IP, CODE, FLAG of the opcode
; that was single stepped.
;
; Shit, just tried Nemesis, and it dissabled the tracer, ;(, and considering
; that I just spent the last 9 hours draining (exploring melbournes underground
; drain + tunnel system) I cant really be fucked at even trying to get around
; this.
