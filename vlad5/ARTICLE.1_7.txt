    Although you might not notice it, the magazine has been greatly
    changed with regards to code.  The viewer was completely replaced
    by a new reader programmed by Dark Fiber.  The reader will now
    display files bigger than 64k, and is very fast.  Added to 
    that, mouse support has been added, better have your mouse
    driver loaded.

    The intro and game were programmed by our good friend Neuron, who
    as usual, put in alot of effort to help with the magazine production.

    NCL93DeV of Immortalia Team did the VLAD VGA and is working on a
    virus demo :)

    We got ourselves a new artist for this issue, Squidgalator ][,
    he did both the vga for the bitmap rotating and the ansi for
    the main menu.

    Using the mag!

    If you wish to skip the VGA intro and piccy, put anything on the
    command line.  That should do it.


    How to use the mouse:

        From the main menu, highlighting an option and clicking the left
        mouse button will take you to the item.

        When viewing an item, clicking the right mouse button will take you
        back out to the main menu.

        To move up and down within an article, move the cursor to the
        direction you wish to view (ie top or bottom) and click the
        left mouse button.  This will either move the screen a page up or
        down.
