
    Secret Area (sssshhh)
    +---------+

    As not to disappoint everyone out there we've prepared a secret
    area full of information that MUST not get into the hands of AVers.
    To access the area type the secret password in at the main menu,
    for those of you who don't believe that such an area exists, try
    typing "virus" from the vlad#2 menu.

    I'm not going to tell you what other thing you will have to defeat
    to see this top secret information, all you need to know is that the
    cursor keys, 'M' and the space bar are all you will need.
