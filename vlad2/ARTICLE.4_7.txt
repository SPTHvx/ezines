   +-----------+

   We have made large advancements on last issue in our coding expertise
   but we intend on getting even better!  There are a number of new
   projects we are thinking of pursuing, anyway here's a short list:

        Windows Virus   -       Yes, we said that we would look at this
                                in the last issue and we still are.
        Multipartitism  -       Combine all our current stuff into the
                                one big virus.
        Disk Ports      -       Using the ports to directly access
                                the drives.  No more interrupts!
        VIP Engine      -       The VLAD Indefinite Polymorphic engine.
                                This has almost already been done, but
                                needs more research in defeating TBScan.
        Misc Projects   -       Some other experimental ideas we've been
                                toying with.

   We won't necessarily do all this for the next issue but we will sometime
   (if its possible).
