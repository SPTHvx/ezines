    +------+

    After hitting IRC to chat on a sometimes dead #virus channel, I've
    had a lot of feedback towards the magazine.  From this I've put
    forward many changes to various things.  There are still people
    asking "what's the password" hehe.. well, try something obvious if
    you don't know :).

    There are 2 parts to the secret area in this magazine, the first
    part being much the same as the last, the guessing of a rather
    simple word to type in, and the completion of the next objective.
    I can't tell you about this part because it's top secret, and in
    the wrong hands it could prove to be dangerous.

    Quite a number of people wanted a text version (I think I've
    mentioned this before heheh).  So we've just left the articles
    as plain text, this is a little bulky, but hey.. you can't have
    everything ;)  Those who don't use the viewer will miss out on
    the secret of a century so they're just lower mortals than the
    rest haha :)

    There were quite a few mistakes in vlad#1.. according to one
    person, the copying routing in the KRAD source won't work.
    According to Qark, Incest.Brother won't work :). heh.. well almost
    everything in this issue should work.  The flash bios infection
    we haven't actually tested but I hope it will ;)

    The sources in issue one were a little bit too complicated for
    me, so I took to learning assembler and my first "real" virus
    should be included in this issue.  I hope it sheds some light
    on how it's done for the beginners.
