    Well here we are, the VLAD magazine issue #2 finally released! We had
    a few problems with BIOS Meningitis towards the end there, and a
    slight rewrite of the magazine code but it's here :).  Unlike issue
    one, all of the source in this magazine should work since we've had
    more time to bug check etc.

    Due to a bit of bitching about us locally here we only released the
    magazine overseas, and our plan seems to have worked.  It has taken
    quite some time for issue one to filter its way into the Australian
    scene.  (not that there is much of a scene here).

    Since the last magazine there has been an addition to the group,
    Darkman being our latest addition.  We hope he will go a long way
    with VLAD and make it much easier for us to release the magazine on
    time :).  It helps to have more than two people writing articles.

    All summed up the magazine isn't too big and the articles are
    fairly short, but I can't really be bothered reprinting fidonet
    flame wars etc.  Just remember it's quality not quantity and I'd
    say we've done a fair job in this one.

    Due to popular demand we have re-released issue 1 of the magazine
    in a text format and that should be working it's way around the
    place right now.  From now on the viewer will read the articles
    from disk rather than having them all included in the EXE file,
    so people will be able to read it as text if they don't have an
    IBM based system or something.

    Anyway, we've definately improved a lot on the last issue and
    there should be a lot better code this time :).  So keep learning,
    coding etc.. whatever, give credit where it's due.
