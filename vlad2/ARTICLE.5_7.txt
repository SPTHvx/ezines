   +------+

   Well, it seems this magazine has come to an end, as per usual we have
   a few viruses done and we write most of the articles on the spot in
   one day.  This is why the whole thing may seem a tad rushed, we're
   always spotting bugs right up till the last minute.

   There will be plenty more issues to come, that's for sure.. we have
   yet to get something from Automag but I'm sure he'll contribute nicely
   to the next issue.  Darkman and I will also put together something
   better for the next one too (well.. mabye Darkman anyway :) hehe).

   It was a long haul there waiting for Qark to iron out the bugs in
   Bios Meningitus but we got there.  I kept telling everyone it would
   be out in the next week, for about 3-4 weeks heh.  We have to work
   a little faster (gheap: we'll get you!! :) and keep releasing issues.

   Not that there is much, but yeah I guess there's a little competition
   around the place in releasing the magazine, plus of course if it
   seems like we've died many people will give up on us and kill our
   distribution sites so :) hehe we'll get there.

   Anyway, expect to see the next vlad magazine sometime around next
   year, perhaps right at the beginning, who knows.  Just have to wait
   till we get more stuff rolling in and Qark and the others to move
   butt and write some more good viruses.

   This issue is a little more packed than the last one, and heh in the
   archive it certainly seems that way (due to this text thingo), I think
   in the next issue we may put the seperate sections in seperate text
   files rather than having one for everything, but as it stands Qark
   can't be bothered changing the magazine code :).

       bye byes from the VLAD crew, and we'll see you next issue..
