  You may notice something in all of the VLAD source code, this is
  the lack of destructive code.  Why?  Destructive code makes the scene
  bad for everyone.  When there's a major trashing by a new virus it
  gives virus authors a shit name, and people generally believe that
  we're computer vandals.  If you have a virus killing hard drives
  everywhere, isn't it slightly obvious that your machine is infected?
  Hmm.. gee, I wonder!  Without the extra code those few crucial extra
  bytes can be saved to make the overall virus more compact and much
  more likely to spread.

  The whole point of releasing the magazine is to educate people out
  there about how virii work and give examples.  The magazine isn't a
  release for lamers to merely change the text in the virus and brag
  to their fellow lamers that they're a big time virus author.
  Anti-Virus research is legal, and this could be a good learning tool
  for someone who is deciding to pursue a career in this field.  Or on
  the other hand, this could be used by a budding virus author needing
  help to get their virus off the ground.  Information is a free
  commodity, we're just passing it along.
                                                                              
  The magazine won't be a regular release, as programming virii
  and coming up with new ideas for them can take some time.  The group
  is small what with only one really dedicated virus author.  People
  around Brisbane don't seem to want to submit any articles to us
  so it's mostly done by a few.  I'm waiting on a few articles of
  some people, but I doubt they'll get given to me before the release
  of the magazine, but hey.. that's always the way man.  So when the
  next magazine is ready, it will be released!

  Has someone ever started talking to you about virii and all of
  a sudden either one of you flicks through the names of all the well
  known virus groups?  It happens to me once in a while.  We'd like
  VLAD to be added to this ever growing hall of fame.  We won't stoop
  low enough to send shit into VSUM for recognition we hope to get
  it by pure distribution of this mag and the spread of the virii that
  we turn out.  To help this along, we're gonna release as much as we
  can, as fast as we can!

  I guess the last aim would be to stay out of trouble!  We don't
  damage any computers with nasty sector trashers or format the boot
  sector on wednesdays at 3pm so there's not too much that can be laid
  on us :).  Since when can writing computer programs be illegal.  Some
  people really have a twisted image of the virus scene in general,
  this doesn't really help much at all.  So, we'll keep trucking till
  we can't no more and there you go.  You want virus?  You got virus!
