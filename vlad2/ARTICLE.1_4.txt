    +-------------+

    Since issue 1 we have gained two new members, also you may remember
    us having a member in #1 who was going to contribute to this issue,
    well due to lack of synapse response from him we gave him the boot :)

    Members..
      Metabolis }
      Qark      } Australia
      Darkman   } Denmark
      Automag   } France

    (VLAD is still Australian based ;)

    Each of us do the same sort of thing, i.e. code and write articles
    so it's not really worth putting in what we each do individually ;).

    If you think you are good enough to join the VLAD team, then get
    in touch with us somehow (check out the dist article) and give us
    an example of what you can do.  Just remember that we don't bother
    with destructive code so if you want to join, that will have to
    apply to the work you do with us.
