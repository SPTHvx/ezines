    Since issue #3 there has been another addition to the VLAD team,
    this is Quantum, another Australian.  He seems to be going quite
    well from the start and I'm sure he'll have a lot to contribute.

    The group now is pretty much full, we don't really have any room
    for more members, but if you have something you want published in
    our magazine, don't hesitate to email me.  Check the next article
    for contact information.

    All of us can code (well.. I try ;) and I kinda run things so
    that's what we all do.  There aren't submitions from all of us
    this issue, but hopefully there'll be one from everyone in the
    next.  Anyways, I got other articles to write heh..
