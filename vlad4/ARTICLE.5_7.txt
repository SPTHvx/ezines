 Well, although we said it for three issues we finally chalked off the
 windows virus.  But will VIP ever be released ?  Who knows.. I have done
 four or five versions of it now, but have been dissatisfied with them
 all.
 
 Since we have done so much in such a short time we have reached a small
 dilemma as to what we should be concentrating on next. Here's a few ideas:

  Super Virus           - Infects just about everything, including windows
                          executables.
  Super-Retro virus     - Attacks every AV software under the sun.
  Polymorphic Engine    - Every second VLAD member plans on doing one of
                          these ;)
  Win-95                - We'll conquer this when it comes out ;)
  Surface Engine        - An engine that goes through the entry code of a COM
                          or EXE file, and allows a virus to insert a jump to
                          the virus body basically anywhere.
  Anti-Invircible virus - An interesting AV program, for sure.

 That ought to keep us occupied.
