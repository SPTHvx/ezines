  Andropinis                    -       Author: Rajaat
                                        Origin: United Kingdom
                                        Type:   Multipartite infector of COM
                                                files and the hard disk
                                                master boot record.  Uses
                                                anti-heuristic tricks to
                                                avoid TBScan.  Full stealth
                                                on the infected MBR.
                                        Note:   This is not a VLAD virus but
                                                a contribution by an

  Super Virus-2                 -       Author: Burglar
                                        Origin: Taiwan
                                        Type:   TSR Polymorphic Semi-Stealth
                                                infector of COM and EXE
                                                format files.  Uses 286
                                                instructions and has a
                                                payload where it writes a
                                                hello message to the screen.
                                                Finds the original Int21
                                                using the Int30h trick.  Uses
                                                Int2f AH=13h to get the
                                                original Int13 and sets Int13
                                                to this before infecting.
                                                Semistealth as it hides the 
                                                file size on functions 11 and
                                                12. Uses unusual undocumented
                                                methods to go resident. 
                                                After opening the file to
                                                infect, the virus duplicates
                                                the file handle, closes the
                                                original handle, and
                                                continues to infect using the
                                                new handle.  Uses the
                                                Phantasie Polymorphic Engine
                                                which makes the virus hard to
                                                detect without the use of
                                                difficult algorithmic
                                                scanning.
                                        Note:   This is not a VLAD virus but

                                                infector.  Most remarkable
                                                for its small size.
                                        Note:   This is not a VLAD virus but
                                                a contribution by an

                                                engine.  Generates random
                                                code which, when executed,
                                                writes a small xor decyptor
                                                to undo the encryption.

  Antigens Radical Tunneler 2.2 -       Author: Antigen
  (ART v2.2)                            Origin: USA
                                        Type:   The most advanced tunneler
                                                ever made, surpassing even
                                                the previous version.
                                                It no longer uses int1 and
                                                the trap flag, instead it
                                                calculates the length of the
                                                instruction, copies it
                                                into a buffer and executes
                                                it.  Get's past every AV
                                                TSR it has been tested
                                                against.

                                                point on COM files because it
                                                checks the code for jmp/call
                                                instructions.  Is only
                                                polymorphic due to use of
                                                the RHINCE engine.

                                                int 28h and infects the
