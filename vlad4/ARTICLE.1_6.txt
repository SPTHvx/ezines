
    The VLAD hidden area
    +------------------+

    As per usual there's a secret part of the magazine which must
    remain out of the hands of the authorities.  It is imperative
    that only those of the VX sector get to read this information.
    
    To get to the secret area you must type in the password from
    the main menu, it will then verify your status and give you
    access if you pass.

    Most people doubt the existence of this secret area but it
    exists in each of our magazines.  If you have vlad#1 try typing
    VLAD from the main menu, this should prove things for you.
