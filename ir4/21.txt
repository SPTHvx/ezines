                   WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE ISSUE #3
                   ==============================

  Okey, this is what's new about us in general, but for a more detailed
  level on what's happened, etc, I suggest that you read the new time-
  line included! 

  MAGAZINE CODE:

  Yeah! We (that's Raver!) have added some code in the magazine itself
  to this issue. The configuration menu is what's new, and I find it
  really good looking too. So, check the configuration stuff with the
  different menu-sets and file-browsers up! It surely is yet another of
  those sweet 'n' crazy idea coming right away from my some sick brain.
  
  VGA & ANSI:

  We've in this issue got ansis from two members of ice! That resulted
  in that the interface is even more cool looking. Of'cos our old
  logos can be chose as well. The VGA-stuff included is also what I
  find nice looking. Thanks goes out to The Sarge and B-Real for this!

  INTERVIEWS:

  Since we recieved lotsa complains about why the interview column was
  deleted in the third issue, I decided to take it back. This time, 
  there were no 'locals' interviewed. As a matter of fact, you'll 
  probably recognize most of the names in the interview column. It might
  be a bit of Trident favoured, but we did our best to cover as many
  different persons as possible. However, we managed to interview such
  nice and 'famouse' persons as Urnst Kouch and Aristotle. Also we 
  interviewed some of our sysops around.
 
  The Wizard was choosen b'cos of that we'd like to 'describe' the
  swedish scene a bit, and couldn't interview our selves- who might be
  the only ones here in Sweden with greater knowledge about it than him.
  Wow, wouldn't that be a bit too much of ego-tripped interviewing our-
  selves (grin!). Beetle was choosen b'cos of that we'd like to have a
  general aspect of the scene. Ie what the now-very-virus-interested
  persons think about different kinda stuff.

  However, we tried to reach some other persons as well, but 1) they
  didn't show up or 2) they were too lazy to take the time for it.
  So.. anyhow, hope you like the idea with the interviews! (Gossip, rag,
  and back-stabbing is what we all like?! <g>).
  
  VIRUSES:

  This time we (Immortal Riot) were a bit lazy with the virus-stuff. As
  a matter of fact, not me (The Unforgiven), Raver and B-Real wrote any
  virus at all. Well, not worth publishing anyhow! But however Metal 
  Militia saved our ass by writing 5 different kinda viruses. Yeah, this
  time he experimented with most virus techniques. This includes
  stealth, non-ow COM & EXE. Spawning and also some kinda crazy
  (original) ideas. Puh! So we can still call us a virus-group!

  Also we got the original source-codes to Macaroni Ted's latest work.
  Yep, this time the source codes to both CyberCide and My Little Pony
  are included. As well as some other viruses which we picked out from
  places where the source couldn't spread out. Enough said about the
  viruses.. Just check the virus column out by your self!

  IR BOARDS:

  First, I'm terrible sorry for what happened one day after the release
  of our third issue. Um, that is when Firedoom Systems left as our HQ.
  All who called Firedoom Systems after they saw the third issue, I can
  only say: Blame the AV! Fuck them corrupt suckers!

  But however, we managed (again) to put up a new Swedish HQ. This time,
  known as The Wizard's Lair. Trust me.. it's definatly worth a call. 
  Anyway, we've also expaned our BBS-distribution system bigtime. Oh,
  for more information, just read the 'How to contact us' article
  included. 

  OTHER:

  Of'cos lotsa other stuff has happened as well. But for more info
  about it, simply read the timeline article included. Thats it, now,
  continue reading the articles included!
