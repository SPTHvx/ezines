                        HOW TO CONTACT US
                        =================

  If you for some reason want to get in touch with us, like to send us
  some messages, articles, viruses, or just chit-chat, the contacting
  problem should now, be partly solved!

  First of all, if you just want to send us some messages, on which
  you want no reply, simply use int.vir on fido-net. We'll read	it.
  If you want more private ways, or replies on messages, etc continue
  reading this article.. 

  Um!. Yeah, we've expanded our ways of contacting in the bbs-community
  pretty much.. We can now be reached in many countries and nets. Okey,
  first, I'll include a list of some boards we frequently call..

  Yes, we are reachable on all these boards for the moment, but I dunno 
  for how long that will last ("Nothing lasts forever" - Guns'n'Roses).
  If you however can call out by yourself, try The Wizard's Lair, which
  we call without doing anything what the law describes as illegal. We
  can also be contacted on for example MobNET, NuKENET and CCiNET.

  We still can't be contacted on InterNET, b'cos we're blacklisted there
  (hm?), but if we continue.. we'll "somewhere in time".... We've also
  thought about a Immortal Riot PO Box or a 'minicall', but it all
  depends on how much you care about contacting us. 

  As noticed, we've expanded our distribution sites with more boards,
  this b'cos we managed to call out. Anyhow, for the one who is
  interested in being a dist-site, just put up a "IR-Distribution"
  on your board, and put our magazine's for free there! Simple as hell!

  I'd here like to thank all sysops, card contributions, and everyone
  who calls, uploads and supports our boards. I know that all of them 
  aren't pure virus-boards, but that isn't our group either. Now, do
  continue reading the magazine, and then, let me know what you thought
  about it. Thanks.
