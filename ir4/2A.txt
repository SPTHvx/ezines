                         IR FOR THE FUTURE
                         =================
  
  This time I don't have any fancy quotations which describes my
  thoughts about the future.. Urm, this b'cos of I dunno shits about it!
  
  Anyhow, the group will however continue, though, I don't think that
  I'll be that active for a while. Yes, you heard me! The stuff I'm
  doing has more and more become a what I see as a duty. It takes time
  that I don't have, and it's not as fun as it used to be.
  
  What we also are doing is very expencive. The telephone bills are
  killing me, although I do phreak my LD calls. The thing we're doing
  is also ideological work, we do it without getting paid. This is
  maybe what is most annoying. The AV-jerks make major money, out of
  what we are doing. That's not fair. But so is the world.
  
  Okey, I'm not saying that I'll drop the whole scene, nor change to
  become AV. All I'm trying to say (just me in person!) is that I'll
  slow down a bit. Urm.. You might think that I'm kinda phucked up
  when saying this, but just look out. It's springtime, the sun is
  shining, the birds are twittering, and I've definitely no motivation
  spending too much time behind the monitor.
  
  Urm.. I'll also try to get my driving-license, learn to program
  better, and also try to study a bit more.. Hrm.. This does not
  however necassary mean that no more issues of Insane Reality will be
  out. It will, it's just all about a question of time.. So please
  spare me all question about the 5th issue.. You'll notice when the
  world is ready for it..

  Again, this was just my personal thoughts! I dunno what the other
  one's are up to. But the group isn't, and will never ever be dead!
  So.. let's quit this article with a nice little message:
  
    "The world will hear from me again!" (The Unforgiven/IR).
