		      PATRICIA M HOFFMAN AND VSUM
                      ===========================
  Article-Info:
  
  Gack! C'mon, please!, read this whole article, specially VSUM vs IR
  (our) comments about My Little Pony by Macaroni Ted of A.N.O.I. As
  usual, the articles are full of other bull-shitting just to piss you
  off as much as possible?! Well, hrm! nahh!.. not really.. ;).
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Something happend.. Today (1994-02-03) I as the first Swede, 
  in the whole country of Sweden (thats it 8 millions Swede's and one
  non Swede's. Oh!, please not this facism shit again!!), I recieved
  VSUM. I even leeched it from her very own board! Oh! How expencive!
  Haha!, it's so funny to see that $0.00 blinking in the right corner
  in the Terminate screen. 
  
  Yes, that's true, why bother leeching this piece of junk every month?
  To confirm to yourself that's full of rubbish and note that not any
  virus you or your group have written, programmed and created are
  included in this "The reference of ALL known virus to PC". Haha!
  Phunny little joke!!
  
  Then when I sat there 'on-line' reading the VSUMX401 summary list,
  I noticed (as usual!) that she once again had excluded our viruses.
  I mean, heck!, this girl (see: bitch!) must have serious problems,
  thats it!
  
  Anyhow.. then I noticed that "My Little Pony" was included. Aha,
  great, she can't have screwed up that description when we commented
  it in our third issue, I thought. Of'cos I was in fact, dead wrong!

  She does probably want rag! And well, Patti, you'll! Those 3-4
  letters should be enough proof about that we'll defend ourselves,
  and not give up as some fucking cripples! HAHA!, Your move, bitch!
  Will you create an "anti-swede" column in next VSUM?
  (hint, hint!).
  
  But what the most annoying thing is, is that this bitch, is making 
  major money out of fooling every scared little PD-geek, who thinks 
  he'll get the right information about a virus, and then by having 
  the correct info, also be able to clean his computer (See: "Delete 
  infected files"), when the AV-programs can't clean it. 

  Yes, this is true, she pays a secretary, a dissassembler, and herself
  from the money she makes on that crappy product. VSUM also got its own
  office, lotsa computers and VMB's. Yessh! This costs lotsa money,
  money that she is stealing from the naive persons who has registrated
  VSUM. 

  Patricia isn't interested in give out the correct information about
  the viruses! All she cares about is the money! (Yet another case of
  greed, I guess!) If she was interested and concerned about the one
  reading VSUM, she'd have changed the information given to her! She
  would also have included all the viruses that she gets her hands on! 
  But she doesn't, and will never do! This b'cos of that she totally ignores
  you! She is what I find a greedy, selfish and corrupt bitch!

  To prove to you, that she is wrong, I'll include her description
  about My Little Pony (for further studies about it, check out the
  source given in this issue!).

  VSUM: About My Little Pony:
  
     Known variant(s) of Cybercide are:             
     MLP-1321: Received in November, 1993, MLP-1321 is based on the     
          Cybercide virus described above.  MLP-1321's size in memory   
          is 1,600 bytes, hooking interrupt 21.  Once memory resident,  
          it infects .COM programs, including COMMAND.COM, when they    
          are executed or opened for any reason.  Infected programs     
          increase in size by 1,321 bytes, though the file length  
          increase will be hidden when the virus is memory resident.    
          The virus is located at the end of all infected programs.     
          The program's date and time in the DOS disk directory    
          listing will have been updated to the current system date     
          and time when infection occurred.  The following text is      
          encrypted within the MLP-1321 viral code:      
          "simple simon met a pieman going to the fair        
           said simple simon to the pieman let me take your ware"  
          "- my little pony - copyright(c) 1993 Cruel Entity and   
           A.N.O.I. -"               
          ">>> A.N.O.I <<<"               
  
          As with the original virus, the DOS CHKDSK program will  
          return file allocation errors on all infected programs   
          when the virus is memory resident.  Execution of infected     
          programs may result in a system hang.          
          Origin:  Sweden  November, 1993.

  Our comments about My Little Pony:
  
  Well, first of all, I wouldn't call this a "variant" on Cybercide
  since the infection-routine isn't the same. OK! OK!, The resident
  code is the same (that's why TBAV & F-PROT & SCAN finds it as
  "Cybercide", but how about the rest of the stuff? Not very much alike I
  think (except for its functions!)).
  
  First let's talk about the encryption. She stated that the virus was
  encrypted. I can only say, NO WAY! Hah! She couldn't have cared about
  the dissassembly that much. She must have seen the text in the
  memory, but not in the files, and then of'cos thought it was hidden
  (encrypted) in the files. 

  The reason why she didn't notice any text in the file was that this
  virus is what she calles it "full stealth virus", ie dis-infecting!
  Um!, I didn't see much of that described in her description!

  But the file-stealth, stuff she told about was correct! But not
  the file-size! Haha, it's 1307 bytes, and not 1321 as she said it
  was!
  
  Then we come to the infection-ways. She told us that it infected
  .COM files when they were executed and opened. Gee! It fucking dis-
  infect the files when they're opened, and well, it INFECTS files when
  they're touched with a dos-dir! Unlike CyberCide, which performed a
  dir-slow-down, My Little Pony doesn't!

  This one starts infecting files after all files in the whole directory
  has been shown, and the user looks at them. This was a pretty smart 
  move, I think. Of'cos she didn't care to write about it. She didn't
  noticed the dir slow-down, and supposed that it wasn't infecting the
  files under a dos-dir, how lame!
  
  Then if we go to the update of time/day after infection, rubbish!
  This virus (as most of the viruses out there today!) saves and re-
  stores the date & time attributes after the file is infected.

  Then if we go for the next point on which we can attack her on,
  the system-hangs. Nah!, Patti, it isn't buggy at all! Trust me!!
  Ohh.. it does however create these CHKDSK fuck-ups, but that isn't
  a bug, it's not just code added!
  
  But anyhow, the text-strings included and the origin was correct,
  bravo! HAHA!! So, tell me now honestly, wasn't her statements just
  PURE rubbish?! 

  Ahh, by the way, this was also (as usual!) destructive! She didn't
  mentioned too much about it being destructive! Who cares about 1307
  bytes more in the files, when it isn't destructive? Oh!, she must be
  quite malicious not to mention that routine!
  
  So, well Patricia, hope you didn't think this critism was too rough?
  You can't live with the truth, can you? But let me tell you the truth,
  and nothing but the truth. Fact is that you are a real-screw-up, a
  born looser! You don't believe in what's right, and are just in this
  business for the money, nothing else!

  I understand if you hate us, this is b'cos of that you can't face the
  reality.. Yes, the Insane Reality ;).. You can't no longer hide 
  behind the lies! We do inform the crowd about VSUM, and it's lack
  of correct information given, and will however continue doing that
  until the time when people understands what's right and what's
  wrong! And trust me on this one Patti! We'll win!

  Oh, Patricia also describes DNR to be CyberCide related.. Isn't there
  any limits for what she can make up?

    General Comments:                     
     The DNR, or Drive Not Ready, virus was submitted in November, 1993.     
     Its origin or point of isolation is unknown.  DNR is a memory      
     resident infector of .COM programs, including COMMAND.COM.  It may      
     be related to the  Cybercide  virus.           
                           
     When the first DNR infected program is executed, the DNR virus will     
  
     When the first DNR infected program is executed, the DNR virus will     
     install itself memory resident as a low system memory TSR of 2,048      
     bytes, hooking interrupt 21.  At this time, the virus will also    
     display the following message on the system monitor:          
                           
        "Drive Not Ready."                
                           
     Once the DNR virus is memory resident, it will infect .COM programs     
     when they are executed.  Infected .COM programs will have a file   
     length increase of 331 bytes with the virus being located at the end    
     of the file.  The program's date and time in the DOS disk directory     
     listing will have been updated to the current system date and time      
     when infection occurred.  The following text string is visible within   
     the viral code in all DNR infected programs:        
                           
       "Drive Not Ready"                 
                           
     The DNR virus uses one file handle each time an infected program   
     is executed.  As the number of available file handles slowly       
     decreases, the system user may find that programs which concurrently    
     open a large number of files may fail to function properly.        
                           
     Known variant(s) of DNR are:              
     DNR-ROM Bios: Received in November, 1993, DNR-ROM Bios is a 397    
         byte variant of the DNR virus described above.  Its size and   
         usage of memory is the similar.  It displays the following     
         message when it becomes memory resident:        
         "ROM BIOS not compatible"             
         Programs infected with DNR-ROM Bios will have a file length    
         increase of 397 bytes with the virus being located at the      
         end of the file.  The above message text string, as well as    
         the following text string, is visible within the viral code:   
         "WHY_ME"                    
         Origin:  Unknown  November, 1993.          
                           
     See:   Cybercide

  IR comments on DNR:
  
  DNR???? What is this virus?? See and cry! Ah, I'm not judging the
  DNR-virus for being lame, however, compare this with CyberCide or
  My Little Pony, and you'll notice, that it isn't alike eachother!
  It's not relative! Not even close! (Both functionally and code!)
  In fact, VERY different!
 
  So.. I think Patricia should go visit AA some time! She can't have
  much of brains, I think..
