  In this article I'll include different 'descriptions' from the Anti-
  Virus program's I've get my hands on.

  Name: MMIR                                 
  Alias: Immortal Riot
  Origin: Sweden                                                               
                                                                               
  Immortal Riot is a virus writing group based in Sweden. They have            
  written several simple and buggy viruses, which they actively spread.        
  Some of these viruses were posted to Fidonet's INT.VIRUS conference          
  as DEBUG scripts in the end of 1993.                                         
                                                                               
  Variant: Immortal.282                                                        
  Alias: Extasy                                                                
  Type: Resident  COM-files                                                    
                                                                               
  This virus contains text 'EXTASY! (c) Metal Militia / Immortal Riot'.        
                                                                               
  Variant: Immortal.392                                                        
  Alias: Ravage                                                                
  Type: Resident  COM/EXE-files                                                 
                                                                                
  This virus contains text  'RAVAGE! (c) Metal Militia / Immortal               
  Riot', and infects also EXE files.                                            
                                                                               
  There is a large number of other viruses authored by this group.

		       HERE COMES MY REPLY!
		       ====================

  Yes, this description was included in F-PROT v 2.11 in the REAL
  program itself..Wow :-) This is pretty unusual.. some of our other
  (among many, Maria K, kiss, kiss..yours moi!, NOT??) was 'just'
  included in the 'new.211' in the same packet..

  First, in the column 'VIRUSES' in F-prot, you can find this text
  under the signature as: MMIR, Immortal Riot, Immortal.282 and
  Immortal.392. Yes, this is true, under 4 alias-names, pretty
  confusing, huh?
  
  It's always funny to see what the AV label your viruses too. I mean,
  John Mcafee, Patricia, and those people located in Santa Clara can't
  have much fantasy. Nearly only 'size-names', boooring! (Thanks Homer!)

  These names, hm?, I find that MMIR (Metal Militia/Immortal Riot?) OK!,
  pretty strange, but still 'OK'. The other names were really quite all-
  right too, with the exception for this 'Immortal Riot' name. Since we
  have up-to-date created, mutated, and hacked atleast 20 viruses, I
  find it quite stupid to label ONE virus after our group-name. And as
  if that shouldn't be enough, Patricia has already labeled a virus:
  Immortal Riot.

  Then anyhow they have after some pretty long time figured out that we
  actually are based in Sweden, and that we're are a virus-writing
  group! Oh! I used to have a lower-ranged opinion about their
  intelligence, but believe it or not, you CAN notice some smarts
  moves afterall..
  								     
  Then, what I don't like (HATE!) is this: "simple and buggy viruses".
  Okey, Extasy/Ravage WAS buggy! We've stated that too. (Check Insane
  Reality issue #3). But the rest of our viruses?? NO WAY! Simple?, well
  well.. I guess this guy isn't very "UP-TO-DATE" or what-ever..Nowadays
  we have written some from scratch and we've written memory resident
  stealth viruses as well. Simple and buggy? Hm!, it all depends what to
  compare with.. Our latest one's are really pretty 'advanced' compared
  to our first six mutations. But if you then compare them with let's
  say a virus like Natas by Priest of Phalcon/Skism, it's really
  nothing.

  Then "which they actively spread". This is not very true, okey, we
  posted the shit on int.vir, but the real spreading is in infected
  programs (ie, EXE/COM). I don't think we spread our products much if
  you compare with the other virus groups. Or well, we NEVER spread a
  virus in executables - that's illegal! (hm? really true?)

  We posted Extasy/Ravage in debug script, that's true. But the rest in
  pure .ASM files! We did this b'cos of that we thought that we're going
  to continue with m (like add size-stealth, self-encryption, etc).. It
  didn't turn out that way since we noticed how buggy the viruses were.

  Anyway, then who is this: Mikko Hyppnen / Data Fellows Ltd, judging
  from his name, he's from Finland. Yes, our neighbour country. Haha,
  some guys in Texas, USA tought that I could call 'LOCAL' to Helsinke
  in Finland (at Assembly '93). Well, Sweden is a small country, but not
  THAT small! The distance is really kinda long to Finland, so since he
  isn't in my 'territory' I really dunno much about him. But what I know
  about him and those Finish jerks aren't very funny..

  They're some of the top writers on int.vir who all of the time claims
  how un-normal, demoralized, and lower-ranged human beings (you name
  all negative word you can figure out!!) we (virus writers) are. He
  claims that we're un-normal. Then what's normal?? Who the F*CK is
  'average??',  I mean, like get laid 0.8 times per week, gets 2.2 child
  per life, and eats 3.6 times per day. I don't know this 'average'
  person. Do you :-)?

  I find that VERY un-normal? (laughter!)..and I find myself VERY
  normal. I KNOW Raver is, and most of the virus writers I've
  chatted, talked or even met private are really normal, so to
  speak. The 'computer-nerds' bullshitting must die out..

  This person? Does he fuck his boyfriend (oh, all AV are faggots,
  right? (nah!)) once a week, but only cumes 80% of the times? Has he
  got three children, but one only with 20 out of the 'average' 100 IQs?
  Does this sound normal? I hope not. Then anyhow, he continued with his
  'analyse' - which was acutally very good. The names, size, texts, and
  infection victims were true. He also said that they were buggy, that
  was also true. Hm!, maybe this guy should take over Patricia's VSUM?
  Anyway, getting back to the analyse and information about 'Immortal
  Riot'.

  "There is a large number of other viruses authored by this group."

  Haha!, I kinda like that quote! Sounds great to me, always funny to
  hear other people talk about you, and your group, without knowing
  who you're. Then anyhow what's really a large number? Do this person
  have our third issue? Is 20 viruses very much? I guess not. I've heard
  some rumours (probably true!) that there are over 4000 viruses out
  there, and more comes in every day. 20/4000, that's 0.5% of the
  viruses. Now, the question is "To be or not to be.." WHAT? Nah, not
  really, what this question is about, is, what's really a large number?

  Now, that's something to think about, isn't it all 'MiCR0-WaR๎ dUD๎Z!'
  Did you get the latest mega (Hi Jennifer!) super-virus generated with
  IVP. You know the 'NOT-PS-MPC-hacked' generator which generates this
  funky randomized NOPs, "thus makes it compleate UNDETECTABLE for SCAN
  and other string-searchers". Yes, "No strings can be used to this
  super-tool. It's just as powerful as MtE". Haha, the scene can be
  really funny sometimes! And that virus which destroys your write-
  protected disks, and blows away your monitor. Do you got those viruses
  too? C'mon, there is lotsa viruses out there, lotsa crap, but please
  don't try with all the horse-shit about the the totally faked up
  functions & quantity.

  Frisk (in swedish means that he isn't ill, virus infected - kinda nice
  name for an AV)) and F-Prot is in my opinion one of the best AV-
  products available. I use F-prot, it's really good. Data-Fellows are
  great, they can make REAL dissassemblies and TRUE analyses, that's
  good! Then, why am I this hard about m. Frankly said, I really
  dunno. If they weren't from Finland and hadn't written "simple and
  buggy" viruses, this article would have looked in another way. 

  But it didn't turned out that way, and I hope that they continue to
  add information about our viruses and group itself too! If they do
  it in the right way, they'll of'cos be higly thanked too. But it's
  seldom the case that the descriptions are true from the AV.
  
  Hm..  Now, let's hear what our friend Dr.Alan Solomon had to say about
  the virus(es). We found this description in the 6.5 packet. I really
  dunno if it's included in earlier versions, I just can't afford
  upgrading it every month (laughter!).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Description:                                                      

    IMMORTAL RIOT has been found in the field at     
    least once. It is quite infectious, and                                     
    results in minor damage (30 minutes). COM        
    and EXE files are infected. COM: 282-392                                    
    EXE: 392 bytes. The virus has a memory-       
    resident infection system. It has minimum                                   
    stealth capability. This virus is not           
    encrypted. There are no other effects.                                      

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Immortal Riot? (OUR GROUP NAME AGAIN!) "Has been found in the field at
  least once". Does int.vir count? Or has various infected programs been
  reported to Alan himself? Quite infectious, hm!, does that mean infect
  on execute, open, ext-open and close? Or what is quite infectious? 

  "Results in minor damage" What's minor damage? I mean, it wasn't
  designed to make any damage "it's unknown what this virus does
  beside replicate" (ref: VSUM). And I still havn't figured out what
  30 minutes is? That's kinda weird I think, 30 minutes? Minor damage?
  It does not make any damage at all, except that it might hang the
  computer once in a while.

  Then the stealth? Oh..I havn't found any stealth routines in it.
  Minimum stealth is what I see as 'size-stealth'. But the rest of the
  stuff is alright, it's not encrypted, and it surely was just
  programmed to replicate.

  There are lotsa discussions on swe.vir as well on int.vir which AV-
  product are the best. The results of which one's the best are always
  that Tbscan, F-prot, Scan, and Findviru (S&S Toolkit) are the best AV
  available today.
  
  That might be true, but what I find strange is that S&S all the time
  claims to be the 'most-user (see: lamer!) friendly'. I don't get
  shits about its description! It's all kinda phucked described I think.
  Do the avarage user understand terms as minor damage and 30 minutes?,
  when I don't? Don't think so! What's quite infectious? There are flaws
  in the explanations here I think. User friendly, up my ass!
  
  Yeh, that's all about what the AV-programs had to say about Extasy,
  and Ravage. I don't think we have recieved any other reports from 
  any other AV-programs (concerning our other viruses!), except for
  CRIS - if you call them AV. 

  Anyhow, CRIS is what I see as some pretty cool thing anyhow. They
  help the scared users lots, by sending out their strings to the
  new viruses. Um!.. Well, yeah, they gave out strings to viruses that
  were included in Insane Reality issue #3.. This included Carpe Diem,
  Doom, Eternity, and Human Greed (Where are the other ones!?!).

  The information they gave out were also correct (nearly anyhow!).
  Haah!, "they", well, they more like took our information that we
  printed, and put out an identification string to detect them. 
  However, Human-Greed could NOT be detected, since it was encrypted,
  which they didn't mention!
  
  Anyhow, I wish CRIS my best, since I think they're the only AV giving
  correct information, and help against new viruses. Oh!.. btw, 100h=
  256dec, and not 255 as they wrote (talking about trashing), but the
  important information was that it caused a bad screw-up, nothing else.
  Now.. continue reading the rest of the articles too!
