  What? First F-prot, then the finish bullentin from F-prot, and two
  entries in the 211 bullentin. Oh, how nice of them! As usual, all
  AV-articles are rubbish.. But let's anyway see what they (The Data-
  Fellows) wrote about us (The new Virus gang, ahh, nice term!).

  Immortal Riot: Yet Another Virus Gang
  -------------------------------------
  Swedish soil seems to provide fertile ground for raising virus groups.
  We remember Beta Boys, Demoralized Youth and the Funky Pack of Cyber
  Punks. Now a new group, Immortal Riot, has entered the scene.

  As of latest knowledge, Immortal Riot consists of four members, all of
  who have some experience in writing viruses. Thus far, the group has
  published and distributed about thirty viruses. Most of these viruses
  are new variants of existing strains.

  The viruses the group has made or modified are not examples of
  technical brilliance. The opposite, in fact. Some of them crash the
  computer or do something else that clearly manifests their presence to
  even the uninitiated. Others are just plain crude.

  The group publishes its own electronic magazine, the Insane Riot,
  which contains articles by the group members themselves and their
  associates, source codes of viruses, and various back-patting and -
  stabbing to other members of the virus community.

		       ====================

  First, Beta Boys, Demoralized Youth, FPCP, that's just two groups. As
  I can remember anyway. The Beta Boys have used the name F.P.C.P and
  are nowadays called A.N.O.I. Then are we THAT "new"? Okey!, really
  pretty new compared to Trident, and NuKE, but he can't however not
  have got the information about us THAT fast afterall. New? Well, just
  another question about definition, I guess.

  Then the funny thing is that he 'excluded' Line Noise. I know that
  they weren't too active and didn't release too many technical advanced
  viruses, but heck - they still were a virus-writing group located in
  Sweden.

  Four members, well I really dunno, we got at the moment just ONE virus
  writer, Metal Militia. Sub-Life has never written a virus, Raver is
  in the army and has very limited time for computers. In fact when he's
  home there's only one thing he's good for: PARTY! Yeah! C'mon, the
  life is really much more important than some viruses, and the scene.
  He still manages to work (tired, and with a huge hang-over hm?), add
  code, and functions in the magazine. I'm just kinda lazy.

  30 viruses? A bit too high, but okey, "works for me!" (Hunter!).
  Then that we just make very simple, destructive and crude viruses is
  really not very true. We have written some destructive viruses, but
  some of our viruses are not destructive, crude at all. They are just
  "replicators".

  Then about our magazine, (You're in it now!) Insane Riot. Geee, have
  this guy even looked through our magazine once? I mean the name, is
  it really hard to get the name? The text-scroller, the articles, the
  info files, etc, shows what the magazine is called, Insane Reality.
  Jerk! 

  Then anyhow, the articles. All our articles have been written by me,
  or Metal Militia. "Associates", hardly. What does this prove to you?
  Does this person have any idea what we've written in our magazine?
  I think not. Then anyhow, it contains source code of viruses. That's
  true, bravo, dick!
    
  "Various back-patting and - stabbing to other members of the virus
  community". Haha! Does this man mean our "CENSOR" statement? Rabid
  is dead, Censor is not given out any more. About the IVP from YAM,
  the information I wrote was correct. About TridenT, we did apologize
  for our "AMF" virus, and havn't written bad stuff about any more
  groups.

  Back-stabbing? In the virus community? Sounds to me like we're this
  totally demoralized rag-group, we're not. I more would claim that we
  always tell the truth about all kinda stuff. Ohh, that can of'cos
  be considered as back-patting, um?!

  I start to more and more dislike all wrong publicity given to us. I
  have nothing against publicity as "The Unforgiven", if the
  information given out is correct and true. What I don't like is when
  someone's going around asking "My-Real-Name" stupid questions about
  our group, and have complete wrong information.

  The media (including the AV-media, such as BULL, etc) always seems to
  exaggerate and make the information look much more worse than it is.
  This is one of many reasons I'm not giving out my real-name, and not
  to much information about me in private.

  If I get a chance to point out how wrong information the AV-geeks
  gives out about all kinda stuff (Patti is the living proof on that!),
  I take it! I'd more say that I enjoy back-patting the AV-community,
  not members (virus-programmers!) in the virus-community. But who
  knows, this guy might know that all AV-wankers also writes viruses
  aswell? Scary thought. Well, enuff said!.. Now big bang in the face!
