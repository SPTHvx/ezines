Introduction:
컴컴컴컴컴컴-
VirStop is a TSR antivirus, distributed in the F-Prot package that is
used by a lot of people to prevent infection by unknown viruses.
Once loaded it performs two tasks:
- makes sure that the executed files aren't infected by a virus
- makes sure that diskettes haven't got a virus in the boot sector

Today we are going to examine the second VirStop feature to understand 
how it works and how we can fool it in our future boot sector viruses.


How VirStop Boot Sector Checking works:
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴-
The boot sector analyzer uses a heuristic scan based on searching for some
little strings frequently found in boot sector viruses.
If one of the search strings is found, VirStop will immediately display 
a warning message to the user.
But there are some backdoors, probably made to prevent VirStop from
giving a warning on a clean boot sector.  These can be used to fuck 
the scan.


Strings:
컴컴컴-
As we said previously, the search strings mustn't be found in the boot
sector, unless you want the floppy to be formatted by all the persons using
VirStop (and there are a lot) or thrown directly in the paperbasket (I can
assure you that this is a very common method of virus prevention).
If you are going to write an encrypted virus you need only check that the
VirStop search strings aren't in the clear part.

Now we are going to give you all the search strings that VirStop checks in
the boot sectors from offset 003h to offset 1FFh to see if the floppy
is infected:

xx   = every byte
xxxx = every word
regx = every register

Backdoors:
컴컴컴컴-
In VirStop there are also 2 very simple backdoors: you must only put
one of these strings in your virus at its own offset:

Offset          String
002F            CD10
0026            593F

The two strings are located in the serial number and in the volume label, 
two zones generally not used by the body of the virus.
When VirStop finds one of these strings it will stop immediately to 
scan the boot sector and you'll be free to use any string that you want 
in your virus.


That's all! Happy coding to all from Dandler and b0z0!
