  		       Anti-Virus results
  		       ==================
  
  Well, since some of our viruses has been out for quite some time, I
  wanted to see how reliable the most popular anti-virus programs could
  detect and identify them. (Scan/F-Prot/Tbscan/AVP/FindViru/MSAV)
  
  The test was done quite roughly, i.e. I just scanned the original
  copy of the viruses, which naturally gave the programs with heuristic
  features an great advantage. But here's the results anyhow.

  IR comments about Scan:
  
  Well, Scan only detected about 50% of our viruses! and as that 
  shouldn't be enough he detected many of them wrong! Yes, wrong! 
  B'cos when we released hacked viruses, Scan couldn't catch any 
  of them! So he's updated his strings, but added wrong information
  about ‚m. Well, I let the result speak for it self!

  IR comments about F-Prot:
  
  Well, he detected 24 of 27 viruses which is a quite okey result, I 
  think! But hm, Maiike.757 as our Unknown Enemy? I guess the Maiike.250
  and Unknown Enemy.757 is pretty much alike? Also, he had some file-
  size messed up on some viruses, but that's of less importance, really. 
  And (unlike Mcafee) he's excused b'cos he often found our hacked 
  viruses before we relased them and then, it's totally meaningless to 
  update the program for our viruses.

  IR comments on Tbscan:
  
  Wow, 100% detection rate! However, some stuff were actually wrong!
  He detected Human Greed as the Vp2X virus and Coke as Burma.
  In the case of Coke, the problem was that Tbscan's scan-string was
  placed in the routine that knocked Vsafe out from the memory!
  
  But one really annoying thing in Tbscan is that the info section sucks!
  Let me give you some "rubbish" in it!
  
  Eternity  - He told me that it was a COM/EXE infector, when it just
              infects EXE files.
  
  Moonlite  - He told us that it couldn't be found with strings, b'cos
              it used a trivial encryption-scheme. That is not correct
              since it uses a simple xor encryption.
  
  Invisible - He didn't mention anything that it was a resident
              size stealth virus!
  
  Psichosis - Psychosis (just a little miss-spelling!)
  
  Riot.1203 - Psychosis? Well, this isn't our's, I think. And if it was,
              it doesn't use a trivial encryption scheme!

  IR comments about AVP 2.00:
  
  Well, 20/27 isn't bad at all! Actually I don't understand why the world 
  havn't paid more attention to this anti-virus program! Heck, it's just 
  as good as F-Prot! It got good heuristic features, though not as powerful
  as Tbscan, I think.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Then, we have Alan Solomon! Haha! What a joke! FindViru 6.52 did just 
  detect one virus! (Phalcon in Maria.com); have a great laugh at him! 
  He probably has hunted virus writers instead of updating his package!
  
  Msav found three viruses (Leech/Leprosy/Seventh Son), which actually
  was better than I thought it would be :). Though, the program still 
  sucks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  So, the (short version of the) results is this:
  
  #  Product:         Infected:    Found:      Percent
  
  1. TbScan 6.22      27            27          100.00%
  2. F-Prot 2.13      27      	    24          88.888%
  3. AVP 2.00         27            20          74.741%
  4. Scan 2.10        27            14          51.852%
  5. Msav             27            03          11.111%
  6. Findviru 6.52    27            01          0.0370%
  
  Well. That's much about it.. Hm, I had my thoughts about releasing
  strings to all of our earlier creations, since I don't want you to
  be infected with ‚m when we've newer, better and more destructive 
  viruses out there.. But if you want good-strings for any virus, 
  just register Thunderbyte anti-virus and try the /extract option!
