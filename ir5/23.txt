                     England Smells   
                     ==============
  
  It's happened.. AGAIN! We all remember the A.R.C.V. bust that was done
  by the New Scotland Yards CCD (Computer Crime Division) which is more
  or less led by the well-known Alan Solomon. This time it's another one
  from England that's in deep shit. A dude that we've heard a lot about
  lately, after his release of SMEG (a new polymorphic encryption engine,
  called "Simulated Metamorphic Encryption Generator") and a couple of 
  viruses using it.
  
  His "break-thrue" was mostly during May this year when they spread
  like wildfire in Great Britain. And once again Solomon saw his
  chance to sell more copies of his AV, thereby getting even more
  famouse than before. With the help of the above mentioned security
  organisation he executed a bunch of search warrants and arrested a
  suspect that was later released after bail had been paid.
  
  He'll have to go back there sometime in November again though, possibly
  to stand trial if the feds has enough evidence and people wishing
  to sue him at this time. All I can say's, it SUCKS! Here follows
  the article asking for people being affected to step forward, and
  (quoting) "scratch one for the good guys". SHEESH!

  Appeal for Information
  
  *** URGENT *** [ Damn right it's urgent.. otherwise they'll have no
                   case against him ]
  
  On Wednesday 13/7/94 officers from Devon & Cornwall Constabulary Fraud
  Squad together with officers from the Computer Crime Unit, New
  Scotland Yard executed a number [ a *NUMBER* of them? They're not even
  destructive damn it!!!!! ] of search warrants under the UK Computer
  Misuse Act in Plymouth. The investigation was in connection with the
  authorship and distribution of computer viruses known as PATHOGEN, 
  QUEEG and GERM, together with the encryption engine SMEG. 1 man was 
  arrested. He has been bailed to return to a Police Station in Plymouth 
  at a date in November. [ Why does Solomon hunt everyone? He's making 
  money on it ain't he? ]
  
  The investigating officers are appealing for anyone who has suffered
  an attack by these viruses to contact the Computer Crime Unit at New
  Scotland Yard on 071 230 1177 (UK) or +44 71 230 1177 (International)
  [ Perhaps one should do an interview with these morons sometime, eh? ]
  
  Scratch one for the good guys! [ Sheesh, go scratch your ass instead..]
  
  Please guys, if you have been hit by Pathogen come forward... [ NOT! ]
  
  Regards, [ yeh, yeh.. ]

  So, let's see what the AV-wankers has to say about those little
  beauties, eh? Here we go, starting off with S&S International
  (Solomon's co-op), letting them tell us all about Pathogen & Queeg
  since they'd the best description avalible at this moment (?).
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
               New viruses: SMEG.Pathogen, SMEG.Queeg
  
  S&S International, developers of Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit, have 
  discovered two dangerous new viruses running wild on British computers. 
  
  The two new viruses, Pathogen and Queeg, have both been written using
  what the virus author, The Black Baron, calls the Simulated Metamorphic
  Encryption Generator (SMEG).
  
  The viruses are highly polymorphic, using an intensely variable and
  large encryption loop. This means that each infection of the virus
  looks completely different to those seen before, making the job of
  writing a reliable detector extremely difficult.
  
  Pathogen and Queeg are memory-resident, polymorphic infectors of COM 
  and EXE files. If Pathogen triggers its payload (between the hours of 
  17:00 and 18:00 on a Monday evening) BIOS level writes are made to the 
  first 256 cylinders on heads 1-4 of the hard disk, and the following 
  message is displayed:
  
   Your hard-disk is being corrupted, courtesy of PATHOGEN!
   Programmed in the U.K.  (Yes, NOT Bulgaria!) [C] The Black Baron 1993-4
   Featuring SMEG v0.1:  Simulated Metamorphic Encryption Generator!
   'Smoke me a kipper, I`ll be back for breakfast.....'
   Unfortunately some of your data won`t!!!!!
  
  The line and other messages contained within the viruses suggest the
  author is British and a fan of the cult science-fiction television
  comedy series, Red Dwarf.
  
  Dr Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit has the ability to find both viruses
  using an "Extra driver".
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  An equal minded thinker
  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
  Yeah! Atlast a destructive fellow, using a good old 256 trashing
  routine. He's the only one except for Doctor Revenge and us that
  I've lately seen skipping the boring nice guy image and started to
  follow the roads of terror instead. I mean, who really cares if you
  get a virus that ain't destructive? Ok, sure it's annoying but you'll
  have all the time in the world to remove it.
  
  If we instead think of a case with one of ours (like Digital Pollution).
  Fine, it doesn't affect your .EXE files but if you just get infected
  somewhere you'll always have it, slowly suffering from CMOS crashes and
  once in a while your polite INT25 suddenly turns into an INT26.
  
  Slowly corrupting and crashing so when you atlast notice it each drive
  and back-up will be (more or less) useless so to speak. I don't really
  see any special difference between XOR's and Polymorphic ones. It
  sure's hell a billion times better encryption, but those who can break
  an XOR can usually do the same with the Polymorphic one so what's the
  point?
  
  I don't think it's bad or anything and every programmer being able to
  create one should, but nothing else really matters than on which
  conditions and which files it infects and the resulting damage. There's
  a lot of polymorphic engines out there (even though SMEG may be one of
  the best?) like MTE, TPE plus another ten or fifteen and not too many
  of them have been used by others than their own inventors/authors.
  
  Black Baron uses BIOS write's (int 13h) instead of INT26 for the nuking
  part (Just like Tormentor always used to do some years ago). A Swedish
  virus named DESPERADO looks quite alike thisone and it has replicated
  quite a bit. Even though Black Barons creations has mostly stayed in his
  homecountry they look to be pretty feared by the society and security 
  parties anyhow. (Just look at the first "article" and you'll get my 
  point..) But they might however shake the world sometime anyhow..
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Now we'll take a look at another of his viruses (not using SMEG this
  time) which is probably one of his first ones. (Dunno how many he's
  written though) Straight out of AVPs Virus Information, the GERM virus.
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
   GERM.255
  
   It's a not dangerous memory resident parasitic virus. It copies itself
   at the address 0050:0100, hooks INT 21h and writes itself at the end
   of COM-files executed. Every 256th generation of this virus displays:
   
   GERM. (C) The Black Baron U.K 93
  
   It contains the internal textstring also :
  
   Better SMEG than dead
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Well, not much help there but it did described the very basics of it.
  Sometimes they forget to mention if it's encrypted, but atleast they
  don't screw-up a description a'la VSUM :) As you see, once again the
  magic number 256 in it, now it has to do with the generation counter.
  
  About the Black Baron
  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
  After what I've heard, the person in question (Black Baron) lives in
  Southhampton and is around 20 years of age. I'm really starting to
  like this guy, just to hope the feds don't waste him. (Co-operations
  that wish to sue someone can be quite dangerous sometimes) So, good 
  luck man, if they really intend to pull this thrue you're gonna need 
  it!
