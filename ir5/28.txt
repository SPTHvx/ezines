	             AVP 2.00 Virus-reports
		     ======================

  Well, here's what a anti-virus toolkit, called AVP, has to say about
  our viruses. I included it, b'cos of it's the only anti-virus program
  that I know with decent descriptions about viruses! So, I hope the
  world will pay more attention to this nice product in the future..

  These are a harmless memory resident parasitic viruses. On
  execution they copy themselves into interrupt vector table
  and hook INT 21h. They write themselves at the end of the
  files on file execution or closing. "Riot.393" hits the
  files on opening and renaming also. "Riot.282" infects
  COM-files only, "Riot.392" infects both COM and EXE. These
  viruses contain internal text strings:

  These are a dangerous not memory resident parasitic viruses.
  They search for COM-files of current directory and write
  themselves file's ends. In some cases "Riot.426,428"
  displays the message "ARBEIT MACHT FREI!" or erases disk
  sector. The viruses contain internal text strings also:

  It's a dangerous not memory resident virus. By using the   
  masks "*.COM *.EXE" it searches for .COM- and .EXE-files of    
  C: drive and overwrites them. It creates the C:\INFERNAL.IR    
  file where it writes the message:

  It's a dangerous not memory resident parasitic virus. It     
  searches for .COM-files of directory tree and writes itself  
  at their ends. On 2nd of every month it erases disk sectors. 
  In some cases it leaves a memory resident program which      
  hooks INT 08h and displays:

  Okey, that was all about the "Riot.Family", hopefully later versions
  of AVP will contain a hell of a lot more viruses in the Riot.Family!
  Anyhow, since we started with hacking older viruses, we also claim
  credits for some of ‚m.

  There are very dangerous non memory resident viruses. They
  overwrite .COM- and .EXE-files of directories of current
  drive. The infected file display "Program too big to fit in
  memory" and return to DOS when starting, these files are not
  restored. Some versions of viruses of "Leprosy" family can
  erase FAT of the current drive. The viruses contain the text
  strings "*.EXE *.COM .." and [varies depending on which variant]

   [ þ Well, myne Leprosy variant only trash the first 256 respecivly
   the 700 on drive C and D: the 10:th any month, so.. þ ]

  the A-V persons wrote about the latest swedish creations.

  It's a dangerous memory resident parasitic virus. It hooks   
  INT 21h and  writes itself at the end of .COM-files on                  
  FindFirst/FindNext DOS calls. On  opening the infected file             
  the virus disinfects it. It hooks INT 09h, 1Ch  also and                
  calls trigger routine from these handlers. On typing "anoi"
  on  keyboard the virus adds "iS AROUND!", on pressing                 
  Alt-Del the virus  displays chars 'A', 'N', 'O' and 'I' in
  four corners of the screen. In  depending of system timer it            
  either displays color cross in background  (looks as Swedish
  national flag), or plays the tune (the Imperial March  from             
  "The Empire Strikes Back") and displays the message and then
  hands  computer up:

  or erases random selected disk sector by the string:

  This virus contains the internal text strings also, some of
  them are written backward:

  IR comments on AVP:

  Ok. As one can see, the information given is very good. Heck, I havn't
  seen an error yet! And beside that, it's got quite allright heuristic
  features, able to detect many complete new, encryted viruses! And it
  also got a very funny demonstration about computer viruses! Do check
  it up!
