                        How to contact us
                        =================

  If you want to contact us, it's this time gonna be a bit harder.
  Why? Well, I only say blame AT&T. Yes, neither me nor Metal Miltia 
  can phreak our calls any more, which naturally have stopped us from
  calling LD.

  If you however just want to drop us some note, on which you want 
  no reply, simply use int.vir on fido-net. We'll read it. If you 
  want more private ways, or replies continue reading this article.

  Well, we still got quite a few distribution-boards worldwide from 
  where you can get our earlier issues of Insane Reality. I don't
  know if they all are still running, got the same number, sysop or
  anything about them. Hopefully they're, so here's the list.

  We can also be reached on NuKENET, and also in the nearest future all
  of us will be hooked up onto Internet!

  However, the best way of contacting us is by calling to The Wizard's 
  Lair / The Hacker's Nightshift. It's a huge underground board, carrying
  most of what the H/P/V has to offer and is definitely worth a call!
