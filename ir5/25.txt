       Alternitive code to avoid detection from heuristic scanners
       ===========================================================

  I shall in this article discuss a few tricks how to use alternitive 
  code to avoid detection from anti-virus scanners with heuristic 
  features. Well. It may be a small article with only a few subject 
  discusses, but rather than copy this code start to think how the 
  program you should defeat works, and then write your own code to avoid 
  it.

  Virus symptoms
  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
  There's a few routines that all parasitic viruses must include.
  The first one is about the delta offset, and the latter write the
  virus to a place from where it can replicate.

  The delta offset
  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
  To get the delta offset is a trick that all parasitic viruses have 
  to use, since the position where the infected programs are loaded into
  memory varies depending on how big the targetted file is.

  Then, there is a simple way to get the delta offset:

  Virus_Start:
  Call Get_Delta
  Get_Delta:
  pop si
  sub si, offset Get_Delta

  Okey, how does this work? The call pushes the ip (Instruction pointer,
  i.e, the location where we are in the code) onto the stack. Then, this 
  location is poped into si and (when compiled) the original offset of 
  Get_Delta is substracted from si, giving you the delta-offset. 
  Plain and simple, huh?

  Tbscan - Entry Point
  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
  Yeh. The above code works perfectly, however it will be detected by
  the heuristic scanners (read: Tbscan) as "Flexible entry point" or
  it might as well detect it as: "Suspicious jump construct", that is
  if you use stupid jump loops to avoid detection. I quote TBAVs 
  documentation for a more detailed information about these flags.

  "E - Flexible Entry-point
  The program starts with a routine that determines its own location
  within the program file. This is rather suspicious because sound pro-
  grams have a fixed entry-point so they do not have to determine this
  location. For viruses however this is quite common: about 50% of the
  known viruses cause this flag to be displayed."

  J - Suspicious jump construct.
  The program did not start at the program entry point. The code has
  jumped at least two times before reaching the final start-up code, or
  the program jumped using an indirect operand. Sound programs should not
  display this kind of strange behaviour. If many files cause this 
  warning to be displayed, you should investigate your system thoroughly.

  Whelp, how are we then going to defeat TbScan? Well, since the
  delta offset usually has to be in a un-encrypted area of the virus
  it makes it a bit more tricky. I.e, we have to use alternitive code!

  FAQ-1 (Frequently asked Question) about this article
  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
  But if we encrypt the rest of the code, Tbscan will not be able
  to trace down the rest of the code, and only that flag isn't enough,
  right?

  Answer
  컴컴컴
  Yes, that is correct, but even if you encrypt the virus (or the whole
  goddamnit targetted file) there is a slight risc that it will detect 
  your decryptor, or even decrypt your encrypted virus, resulting in 
  that Tbscan detects all virus-sympthoms. Yes, from TBAV 6.20, it 
  decrypts (some) encrypted viruses. It also got two flags to detect
  your decryptor, b'cos encryption is *THE WAY* to avoid detection
  from it (something Franz really hate).

  Tbscan - Encryption detection
  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
  Again, I quote Tbav's (great) documentation:

  "# - Decryptor code found
  The file possibly contains a self-decryption routine. Some copy-protec-
  ted software is encrypted so this warning may appear for some of your
  files. If, however, this warning appears in combination with, for 
  example, the 'T' [Invalid time-stamp] warning, there could be a virus 
  involved and TbScan assumes the file is contaminated! Many viruses 
  encrypt themselves and cause this warning to be displayed."

  Yes, if a program only contain that flag, it'll not give a warning to
  the user, however if all files contain both the "#" flag, the "E" flag,
  they will receive a warning. But if 'only' one of those flags is shown
  in all the scanned file, the user will most likely be quite suspicious.

  But since Tbscan is a great program, it can also detect your decryptor
  with the "G" (Garbage instruction) flag. Let's examine what that mean!

  "G - Garbage instructions.
  The program contains code that seems to have no purpose other than
  encryption or avoiding recognition by virus scanners. In most cases
  there will not be any other flags since the file is encrypted and the
  instructions are hidden. In a few cases this flag will appear for
  'normal' files. These files however are badly designed, which is the
  reason the 'garbage' flag appears.

  Okey, it's a flag specially for SiC, I guess ;) ). No, actually if
  your virus got some bad structure with lots of totally meaningless
  jumps and dummy op-codes this flag that will be displayed. Why?
  Well, b'cos when we call the decryptor the jump-construction will look
  quite dumb, and that's what Franz outsmarted!

  FAQ-2
  컴컴
  "So, how can we now prevent your virus to avoid detection from
  detecting the flexible entry point flag?"

  Method 1
  컴컴컴컴
  Actually the code is very simpel, and you should be familiar with
  both the routines used, though maybe not slapped togheter.

  Virus_start:
  xchg ax,ax
  mov ax,0fa01h
  mov dx,5945h
  int 16h

  call get_delta
  Get_delta:
  pop bp
  sub bp,get_delta-virus_start

  ... rest of code virus code ...

  Is that it? Yes, that's it! Hrm, what it does is simpel. First it 
  exchanges the ax register with itself (Dummy no-operation, that is 
  equal to a NOP). Then, it knock's out Vsafe from memory, and after 
  that, we get the delta offset. Try it out! It worked for me and Tbscan 
  didn't report it as flexible entry point! The code looks quite ugly but 
  by darn, it works!

  Also, you could write some other code instead of knocking down MSAV
  from memory, but since I put two useful routines into one, I think
  it's okay anyhow. Or as we say in a swe-english:
  "I smashed two flies in one smash". (grin)

  That's all from me, now, it's Raver's turn!

  More anti-tbav
  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
  Well, the description above works (as The Unforgiven said), but it
  might be good to know some more theory about it. So, I shall now
  present some other ideas, and code examples for you..

  Since I'd get quite suspicious if all my files had a "flexible entry
  point" I decided to do something about it. It was quite clear that
  the standard pop instruction caused the flag and therefor we must use
  an alternative way to get the value on the stack without poping it!

  In Carpe Diem and Doom I used the code described here:

  Outdated method
  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
  start_of_virus:

      call get_offset
  get_offset:		
      mov di,sp
      mov bp,word ptr ss:[di]
      sub bp,offset get_offset
      inc sp
      inc sp

  To understand this it's important to know how the stack works. The 
  first value on the stack is located at ss:[sp] (in memory). When a 
  word is poped from the stack it reads this word to the specified 
  register (usually bp or si) and adds 2 to sp. In this code, we put 
  sp in di and use ss:[di] and then manually add 2 to sp, which gives 
  us the same result as a pop bp.

  However, TBAV has now updated the heuristic features to also detect
  the code described above. So I'll now present another (better) way to 
  avoid a flexible entrypoint flag, which is used in my latest virus, 
  Digital Pollution.

  Method 2
  컴컴컴컴
  entry_point:
      mov sp,102h
      call get_bp
  get_bp:
      mov bp,word ptr ds:[100h]
      mov sp,0fffeh
      sub bp,offset get_bp

  Since the first three bytes of the infected file will be restored later
  we can use these bytes as a temporary storage place. In this example I
  use it to put the sp to point to this offset (cs:100h). When call 
  get_bp is executed the ip-value will be located at offset 100h. Then 
  it's just to get that value and restore the sp to 0fffeh, which is the 
  default value for sp.

  As you can see from these two examples, the way to avoid a "flexible 
  entry point" flag is to manipulate the stack in a non-standard way. By 
  now you should probably have some own ideas how to fool TBAV and other 
  heuristic scanners - It's always best to be original!

  Tbscan - Decrypts new viruses
  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
  Ok. The Unforgiven back on the keys again. Well, it's all clear that
  Tbav is the best anti-virus programs available today and then, 
  naturally it is our mission is to defeat it!

  Well, since the release of 6.20, it was even harder to cope with the
  improvments in it! Why? Well, I quote the whatsnew.620:

  **************************** Major update! ****************************
        A breakthrough in the battle against polymorphic viruses!

  TbScan now has the ultimate answer on encrypted viruses. To cope with
  the ever increasing amount of polymorphic viruses, polymorphic engines,
  encryption engines, etc. we implemented a real code emulator in TbScan.
  This code emulator automatically decrypts any encrypted virus without
  any information about the specific virus. The current version decrypts
  MTE, TPE, URUGUAY, DSME, DAME, DESPERADO, NED, KRUEGER, SMEG (pathogen
  and queeg) PHANTOM_1 and many other viruses reliably. This has several
  implications:

  Well, let's skip the rubbish, what he mean is that he by now, can
  detect polymorfic viruses with scan strings and also easily distinguish
  between different viruses which have been encrypted by the same engine. 
  Funny for him, isn't it?

  But he continues with a statement, that is more brag than fact.

  Tbscan - brag
  컴컴컴컴컴컴
  "The combination of heuristics and a generic decryptor makes a real 
  joke of even the most complex polymorphic viruses at forehand, even
  before we have received a copy of these viruses!"

  Well, this isn't quite true. For example, I've written four xor-
  encrypted viruses to this issue, where tbscan 6.22 cannot detect 
  one singel flag in any infected file! Raver's Digital Pollution 
  as well as some viruses from Metal Militia are also complete 
  undetectable from Tbav since he cannot decrypt them!

  Gee.. what a fuck-up-ment statement isn't the brag above then? Heck,
  an xor-encryption is what 99% of the encrypted viruses uses, and
  if the above quotation should be true, he should laugh about our
  encrypted viruses as well. ...but he isn't!

  Then, why can't he decrypt them? Heh. I actually don't really know 
  since I havn't bother to taken it apart. Anyway, I still got the 
  solution to how to defeat his decryptor. It's really quite a piece 
  of cake, or a cheesecake as The Attitude Adjuster would have said!

  Just place the encryption somewhere else, and if he still decrypt 
  your virus, continue to move it around until he fail to decryp it!
  Hm. Maybe not the best solution, but trust me, it works! He cannot
  decrypt any encrypted virus since he sometimes fail to detect the
  "#" or the "G" flag described above! Then, if he fail with detect
  your encryption routine, how the fuck can he then decrypt it?? :).

  But there was more improvments in 6.20, for example this:

- TbScan is now even better able to determine the program entry point,
  no matter how the route to the viral code is implemented. 

  Tbscan - changing because of us
  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
  Hehe, do you know why he changed that in his program? Well, let me
  say b'cos of two products, Carpe Diem and Doom! Yah, he just couldn't
  stand our alternitive code! But however, the above quotation is as
  well brag and empty claims! Hence, this article is the proof about 
  that!

  Also, Franz often changes his program after how new viruses are
  written. The above is probably (as I said) as a result of Carpe Diem 
  and Doom, then, the below is as a result of The Lemming virus created 
  by a nice "Aussie-Nuker" who want to remain anonymous :).

  "A final word about the emulation. The emulation performed by TbScan 
  is purely software based. No instruction of the file to be examined 
  will ever be 'executed'. "

  Tbscan - more flaws
  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
  Well well well, what's now left in this anti-tbscan article? Hm? Yeh,
  now I remember! You know Tbscan's code-analyzer (Heuristics) features?
  This program works really quite alright, but it surely got a few flaws,
  and that's the key behind getting undetectable viruses!

  Let me give you an example about 40HEX (Write to file or device):

  Write_Virus:
  mov ah,40h			      ; Write the code
  mov cx, virus_end - virus_start     ; Write all of the virus!
  lea dx, [bp+virus_start]	      ; Write from virus_start
  int 21h                             ; No comments!

  Yes, you probably recognize the above code? Right!? It surely works,
  but again, it's not good b'cos Tbscan can detect it with the "F" flag.

  F - Suspicious file access
  TbScan has found instruction sequences common to infection schemes 
  used by viruses. This flag will appear with those programs that are 
  able to create or modify existing files.

  Yes. Sure the file got suspicious file access, but that's not what's 
  important. No. What is interesting is how we can cheat Tbscan!
  Well, it's really all trivial.

  Just (for example) exchange the:

  mov ah,40h

  to:

  mov ah,41h
  sub ah,1h

  or:

  mov ah,30h
  add ah,10h

  That's it! No more, no less! How does that work then? Well, since
  Tbscan's read what kinda instruction there is in the function register 
  line by line (like a dissassembler!) it's clear that the first example
  look like it would delete a file! (41h/int21h) Pretty logical, eh?

  Closing words
  컴컴컴컴컴컴
  So now, create your viruses with (if necessary) alternitive code
  to avoid detection! It'll cost you some bytes but hell, it's worth it!
