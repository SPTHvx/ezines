		       Viruses in Vsum
		       ===============	  
			    or
   		  "Shit where shit is due"

  As usual, we give Patricial M. Hoffman and VSUM a very own entry in 
  our magazine. So Patti, will we get an own entry in your magazine? :-).
  Heh. Anyhow, some virus-writers refer to VSUM as the "Virus writer's 
  bible" however I would rather call Ralf Brown 'Jesus' and his 
  Interrupt list the "virus-writer's" the bible. But oh well.

 General Comments:                                                             
  The MMIR or MMIR.Extasy virus was submitted in April, 1994, and is      
  from Sweden.  It is a memory resident infector of .COM programs,        
  including COMMAND.COM.                                                  
                                                                                
  When the first MMIR infected program is executed, this virus will       
  become memory resident in a hole in allocated system memory, generally  
  a buffer area at 0000.  Once memory resident, it will infect .COM
  programs when they are executed.
                                                                                
  Programs infected with the MMIR virus will have a file length increase
  of 282 bytes with the virus being located at the end of the file.  The
  file's date and time in the DOS disk directory listing will not be
  altered.  The following text string is visible within the viral code
  in all infected programs:

        "EXTASY! (c) Metal Militia / Immortal Riot"

  System hangs frequently occur when programs are executed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Now follows Immortal Riot's comments about Extasy:

  Well. This description is nearly 100% correct! However, Extasy also 
  infected upon opening, which caused the system-hangs. This bug was
  however fixed by me, so now it's another newer version of it out
  somewhere, that definitly works to 100%!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Known variant(s) of MMIR are:
  MMIR.Invisible Evil: Based on the MMIR virus, this 769 byte
     variant infects .COM files, and is a size stealthing virus.
     It becomes memory resident at the top of system memory but below
     the 640K DOS boundary, not moving interrupt 12's return.  Total
     system and available free memory, as indicated by the DOS CHKDSK
     program, will have decreased by 1,600 bytes.  Interrupt 21 will
     be hooked by the virus in memory.  Once memory resident, it
     will infect .COM files, including COMMAND.COM, when they are
     executed.  Infected programs will have a file length increase of
     769 bytes, though the file length increase will be hidden when
     the virus is memory resident.  The file's date and time in the
     DOS disk directory listing will appear to be unaltered, though
     the seconds field will have been set to "02".  The following text
     strings are visible within the viral code:
     "Our past is our future! ‹î"
     "[INVISIBLE EVIL!] (c) Metal Militia/Immortal Riot"
     "Dedicated to all the victims.."
     "Greets to B-real!/IR"
     "It's like this and like that and like thisena"
     "It's like that and like this and like thatena"
     "It's like this.. &"
     "Love to Lisa!"
     "All i ever wanted.."
     "All i ever asked for.."
     When this virus is memory resident, non-infected .COM files will
     appear to have decreased in size by 769 bytes while infected
     files will have no change in file size.
     Origin:  Sweden  May, 1994.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Now follow Immortal Riot's comments about Invisible Evil:

  First, it's not a variant of Extasy! As you can see, the memory 
  routine used in Invisible Evil is the 'standard' way of making 
  viruses resident, and not as in Extasy, which was somehow unusual. 
  Then, the infection routine is completely new written! ..and 
  actually there aren't many similarities between thoese viruses 
  than they both are resident infectors of COM programs.

  Then let's us investigate her claims about the stealth capabilities. 
  Yes, it is a size-stealth virus, that checked the seconds for "02", 
  and if the second-value matched, it'd simply decrease the filesize 
  with it's own lenght. However, if a un-infected COM file was shown 
  with a dos-dir Invisible Evil wouldn't decrease the filesize with 
  769 bytes, unless of'cos the file already had the second-value set 
  to 02. But she claimed that all uninfected files shown had decreased 
  by 769 bytes, which of'cos isn't a true claim. Also, our Invisible.Evil
  released in IR#4 was 786 bytes and not 769 bytes! Otherwise, a pretty 
  okay analyze.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  MMIR.Moonlite: Based on the MMIR virus described above, this is a
     458 byte variant.  It becomes memory resident as a low system
     memory TSR, hooking interrupts 09 and 21.  When an infected
     program is executed, the virus will check to see if all of the
     .COM files in the current directory are infected.  If they aren't,
     it will infect them.  If they are, it will delete the .COM
     program the user was attempting to execute.  Infected programs
     increase in size by 458 bytes with the virus being located at the
     end of the file.  The program's date and time in the DOS disk
     directory listing will not appear to be altered, but the seconds
     field will have been set to "42".  The following text strings are
     encrypted within the viral code:
     "Metallic Moonlite(c) Metalic Militia/Immortal Riot"
     "Greetings to The Unforgiven/IR"
     "Bad command or filename"
     "*.com"
     In addition to deleting .COM files, the virus will delete any
     .EXE programs executed when the virus is memory resident.
     Origin:  Sweden  May, 1994.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Now follow Immortal Riot's comments about Metallic Moonlite:

  Well, this isn't neither a memory resident virus nor a variant of 
  Extasy. It's simply an encrypted direct-action infector of all COM 
  files in the current directory. However, it got a small TSR routine 
  which will go resident the 5:th any month, deleting all program's 
  touched with the function 4bh/int21h (load/execute for short). When 
  resident, it'll also make a 'ctrl-alt-delete-warm-boot' into a 
  'coldboot'. So, I guess they 'analyzed' this virus the 5:th of May, 
  and didn't check the code enough!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  MMIR.Ravage: Based on the MMIR virus described above, this 392
     byte variant also infects .EXE files.  It uses the same technique
     to become memory resident.  Once resident, it infects .COM and
     .EXE files, including COMMAND.COM, when they are executed or
     opened.  Infected programs increase in size by 392 bytes with
     the virus being located at the end of the file.  The program's
     date and time in the DOS disk directory listing will not be
     altered.  The following text string is visible within all
     infected files:
     "RAVAGE! (c) Metal Militia / Immortal Riot"
     Origin:  Sweden  April, 1994.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Now follows Immortal Riot's comments on Ravage:

  Yes, this virus is definitely based on the Extasy virus, and it's
  as well as Extasy, correct described! (Bravo!) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Also, an very old virus I wrote years and years back (grin) was included 
  in VSUMX9406, so I guess I will include her description on that virus 
  as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Seventh Son.426: 

  Seventh Son.426 is a 426 byte virus based on the Seventh Son virus.
  It infects all .COM programs in the current directory when an infected 
  program is executed.  Infected programs will have a file length 
  increase of 426 bytes with the virus being located at the end of the 
  file.  The program's date and time in the DOS disk directory listing
  will not be altered.  The following text strings are visible       
  within the viral code in all infected files:           
  "ARBEIT MACHT FREI!"                                   
  "The Unforgiven / Immortal Riot  Sweden 01/10/93"      
  "*.COM"                                                
  Origin:  Sweden  April, 1994.                          
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Now follows Immortal Riot's comments about A.M.F:

  It surely was based on The Seventh Son virus, created by TridenT some
  years back, and it's the virus we've received lotsa shits for. Anyhow,
  how about her description?

  Well, it's really quite alright, except that she didn't mention much
  about it's destructive features, as well as the dot-dot routine I added.
  The pay-load was really quite cruel, the first day any month, it was
  programmed to wipe out C and D:. Also, as one can see in the virus, it 
  was written in October 1993 rather than April '94. But oh well, you 
  can't get it all :-).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Immortal Riot's general comments about VSUM:

  Her description of our viruses has definitely improved, I think. Before
  our complaints on her, they sucked, but all sudden Patricia started to 
  listen to us. Who would ever believe that? :-). ... and as a result
  of that we'll be not be as hard on her as we might have been before. 

  No, I'm not saying that we'll give up the truth just to be nice towards 
  Patricia, but heck if we complain about true statement, we would be
  the lyers and that's not my point. To throw dirt on someone who are
  telling the truth is really low. So, I really hope Patricia and Chris 
  keep on improving the description concerning our viruses as well
  as all the other viruses. Hopefully she'll also change the description
  when she receives new information about a messed-up-described virus.

  Heck, next article about VSUM might even be labeled:
  "VSUM- Worth every minute downloading" or why not even:
  "VSUM- Worth it's bytes in gold". Though, I doubts about it :-). Heh.

  Her description on the Desperado family was quite alright too though,
  she forgot the mention that it was highly polymorfic. And as a beside
  note she told us that Nostradamus Old Scribe (read: YB.Old.Scribe) 
  virus was written in Sweden as well as the Mayberry family. This is 
  not very true, only, party true. Eh? Lemme explain. The Wizard's Lair 
  has soon become one of the largest VX boards worldwide, and it's a 
  board to which most of the new viruses get uploaded to. No doubt about
  it! And I guess someone on that board supplies/sells new undetectable
  viruses to the swedish-anti-virus jerks (They bought viruses from 
  Bulgaria during the days of the Virus eXchange in Sofia some years 
  back..) and those suckers probably upload the viruses right to Mcafee
  from where they go to Patricia. Well, I don't know really, it's only 
  my best guess.
