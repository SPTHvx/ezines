  		     More virus-generators
  		     =====================
  
  I first want to do something that I'm not allowed to do. Eh? What?
  Well. I quote F-bull 2.07 which was released in February 1993 and
  in where they tried to foretell the future, i.e. what would happen
  in 93/94. 
  
  Quoting F-bull
  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
  o   More and more viruses have been appearing in shorter and shorter
      periods. We believe the growth rate will start to turn down.
      More viruses will still be developed in even shorter periods of
      time, but the growth rate will not increase as fast as before.
  o   There will be more polymorphic viruses.
  o   The amount of viruses that attack specific anti-virus 
      programs will increase.
  o   Toolkit programs for making viruses will grow more common
  o   Viruses for the Windows and OS/2 environments will 
      become more common.
  o   The first cross-platform viruses will appear.
   
  Bravo - F-bull
  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
  Well, since the release of F-bull 2.07 we've seen many new viruses
  being developed, hacked, mutated or mass-produced-code-generated
  (Bravo).
  
  Then, the scene has received quite a few new polymorfic viruses, 
  engines, and anti-anti-virus so I guess he's right here as well. 
  But, that's not what I was going to write about. Nah. What's 
  interesting here is his guess concerning the "mass-producers". Well,
  since VCL, PS-MPC and G2 already are "legendary", he naturally 
  thought that more people would start to produce such toolkits! Right?
  
  What happened..
  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
  Oh well, but what happend? Silence.. Not too much!! Actually, since
  the release of G2 there was a long silence concerning those "toys".
  Why? I don't really know, maybe people realized that they couldn't
  write a better tool than G2 or something? (Just my wildest guess!)
  
  Anyhow, after about one year and three month later a new toolkit
  was released. This time, by a complete new group. Well, actually
  I don't know if they group itself was new, but what I do know is that
  they're new into viruses. Of'cos talking about Simply Insane Coderz,
  or SiC as they call themself.
  
  Sic virus creation laboratory
  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
  Well this generator called SiC ViRUS CREATION LAB is somehow reminding 
  of VCS. Though, the main difference is that this toy was written in
  1994 instead of 1989. The features are pretty much the same.
  
  SiCVCL? :) can only produce non-encrypted run-time virus that infects
  all COM files in the current directory in one singel run. The viruses
  created with the "creator" doesn't vary for shits. Oh, (of'cos) except 
  for the text string you're allowed to include in the virus :-). ..and
  if that shouldn't be enough, the generator produces dysfunctionabel
  as well as scannable code! Gawn.
  
  Yah. How impressing, not! Well, but to back up my claims I started
  to dissassemble the code. ...and well, this is a byte-to-byte match-up
  dissassembly of the virus, so you can check the code up for yourself.

  Sic stupid ideas
  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ 
  Well, as you could see, there was no reason to spread out a whole
  generator for this purpose. Heck, why not instead just release a
  source code to a virus, let the jerks change the text-string in it,
  and voila!? This generator includes no more feature than that.
  
  But now, let's not discuss this generator any more, instead let's
  talk about what happened after the release of SiC. Suprise Suprise!
  Yah. Another generator known as "Biological Warfare" and created by
  MnemoniX was released!
  
  Biological Warfare
  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ 
  This creation was far better than for instance VCS and SiC. Actually
  it had features that none of VCL, PS-MPC and G2 had, stealth. Well,
  let me quote the documentation from version .090á.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  A) Text - Any text you wish to appear within the virus, up to 
     60 characters.
  
  B) Resident - Specifies whether virus will be resident in memory or 
                not. "Y" specifies a resident virus.
  
  C) Infect - Either COM, EXE, or both. Infects the corresponding files.
  
  D) Encryption - "Y" specifies that the virus will feature encryption. 
                   The program implements a few different encryption 
                   algorithms in a number of different ways for variety.
  
  E) INT 24 Handler - "Y" specifies that the virus will steal DOS's 
                       critical error handler to avoid write protect 
                       errors.
  
  F) Anti-Trace - "Y" specifies that the virus will includes routines to 
                   thwart trivial debugging or tracing.
  
  G) Maximum Size - Either Y or N. If "Y" is selected, the virus will not 
                    infect any .COM file too large for it. 
                    (.COM infectors only)
  
  H) Traversal - "N" specifies that the virus will only infect in the 
                  current directory; "Y" specifies the virus will move 
                  upwards in the directory tree. 
                  (Non-resident viruses only)
  
  I) Infections/run - Maximum number of files to infect each run. 
                      Selecting "0" will cause all possible files to 
                      be infected. (Non-resident viruses only)
  
  J) Avoid COMMAND - "Y" specifies that the virus will not infect 
                      COMMAND.COM. (.COM infectors only)
  
  K) EXE Marker - Two characters used to indicate an infected .EXE file. 
                  (.EXE infectors only)
  
  L) Overlay check - "Y" specifies that the virus will not infect .EXE 
                     files with internal overlays. (.EXE infectors only)
  
  M) DirStealth - Hides the file size increases from a directory listing.
                  All infected files have their seconds field set to the 
                  given number. Absence of this number indicates that no 
                  directory stealth function will be included. 
                  (Resident viruses only)
  
  N) Infect on -  Specifies what conditions the virus infects under. 
                  "EXEC" specifies that the virus will infect on execute;
                  "OPEN" specifies that it will infect on file opening; 
                  and if both are given, the viruses infects on execution 
                  and file opening. (Resident viruses only)
  
  O) Activate - If "Y" is chosen, the virus will include space for an 
                activation routine in the code.
  
  P) More dir stealth - A last minute addition. This may be only used 
                        in conjunction with directory stealth; it will 
                        make the increase in file size invisible from 
                        any file managing programs in addition to a 
                        DIR command. If "Y" is chosen this feature is 
                        added. (Resident viruses only)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Not for lamers
  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
  Well, as one can see, this is a great tool, though it'll sometime
  produce code which cannot be compiled without altering. But heck, 
  since he later mentioned that the tool wasn't for non-programmers,
  and other morons it doesn't really matters, b'cos they were all
  easily fixed. 
  
  Complains/Jokes - without any reason
  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
  Also, he stated in P) (4eh/4fh stealth) that the file size was 
  invisible from ANY file managing programs. Well, not really, eh?
  
  Imagine this program: It opens a file, seek the end of file (ax=4202h)
  compare it with the value you get displayed from the files when using
  the functions 11/12/4e/4fh/int21h. ...and if something didn't match,
  you just convert the value in ax (filesize) into ascii and display it!
  
  Hm. I think you also could read direct from the FAT and from there
  get the size of the file, etc. but oh well, that's of less importance!
  What's of importance is that this program is just great, and I'm
  looking forward to see version 1.00 of it, maybe (as he said), carrying
  these features:
  
  Biological Warefare 1.00
  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
     * Polymorphism (with my own MutaGen encryption engine)
     * More stealth abilities
     * Anti-AV techniques
     * Boot sector infection, if I'm feeling ambitious
  
  So now folks, go get a copy of BW90á.??? (Password: Lo Tek) and
  start cream out all the BW-generated viruses around!
