              What's happening with the virus writer's...
              ===========================================
  
  It is apparent to even the blindest of observers that the "I create
  only nice viruses" phonomenon has caught on. Everyone in nearly all 
  groups have decided to create viruses as harmless as possible. 
  Of'cos, no names will be mentioned, as that would be mean and we all 
  wish for a happy world :-). Heh. Somehow reminding on Dark Angel
  english, but no hard feelings DA, I admire your way of using the 
  english language as much as your way of writing assembly language!
  
  Papers - correct
  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
  Yeh. We all have heard from the papers, etc that all viruses are 
  destructive, and heck they might (for once) be right! This will 
  not to many virus writers agree me on, but think again (and again,
  if necessary), and soon enough it will make perfect sense!
  
  I changed my mind concerning this after reading Ian Douglas three 
  long articles posted (twice) on Fido-net. Thanks Ian ;-).
  
  I don't have a copy of his article, since I normally don't save
  my mail from him, b'cos his opinion normally sucks bigtime. However,
  I'm pretty sure you've read it atleast once, and I think I remember
  it quite alright, so there's really no need for pure quotations.
  
  Computer viruses = destructive
  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
  I mean, a virus can harm people/programs/computers even if it wasn't
  what it was meant to do. Let's give you an example: If company
  "A" give a disk with some demo on to company "B" and the disk is
  infected with a "un-destructive" virus like Yankee Doodle, company
  "B" start it and 5.00 AM it starts to play a little tune. Company
  B of'cos discovores and they soon enough find out that they got it
  from compay "A". Now, isn't the trust of those companies harmed?
  Definitely! The virus caused trouble, ie, it was (for them)
  destructive!
  
  Also, let's say that company B was a hell of a big company, with a
  networkd including 1500 comuters! Ok. I don't need to write about this,
  I'll simply quote Approaching Zero (about the Eddie virus);
  
  "We lost $500,000 of business--really lost business, not orders 
  deferred until we could catch up, but business that had to be done 
  there and then or it went to a competitor," said the company's chief 
  financial officer. "We also lost data. That cost us $20,000. But what 
  really hurt was the lost business. If we force a customer into the 
  hands of a competitor, he might go there again. I guess that could 
  cost us another $500,000."
  
  Ok. Eddie was a destructive virus, but the main cost was b'cos of
  they had to close down their entire network, the time it took to
  wipe out the virus and then, re-install all programs. ...and not b'cos
  it destroyed data.
  
  Also, if you say something like "But they should be able to detect
  the Eddie virus, if they don't, they deserve to get struck with it!".
  Yeh, right!? Oh well. If they first use anti-virus programs, those
  greedy anti-virus-vendors earns money, and the company has to pay for
  the program. The fear for getting struck with a virus has has already 
  here costed them some cash. Heck, upgrades on anti-virus programs isn't
  the cheapest! "And you gotta upgrade every month!" :-).
  
  So.. this was just a fiew view's out of the article Ian posted 
  (there were like 50 more if you're interested!), and well I hope 
  I've got you thinking.. 
  
  Bad influence
  컴컴컴컴컴컴
  Then, why am I writing this article? To fill out the magazine?
  To make Immortal Riot look cruel? No! What I'm trying to say to 
  the other virus writers in the other groups is very simple:
  
  "Harmless viruses doesn't exist, so make them destructive!"
  
  Yeh. Wouldn't it be fun to see some nice pay-loads from the other
  groups as well? Heck, imagine if NuKE, Phalcon/Skism and TridenT
  started to create as annoying viruses as possible! ... and later
  printed all of 굆 in their magazines! Wow. This would be something!
  
  However Immortal Riot are going the opposite direction, that is to
  create destructive viruses and spread them as much as possible.
  Therefor, I've outsmarted some ways of getting the viruses around.
  
  First, the secret is: fake logins (duh!). Yes, create as many different
  accounts on as many boards as possible. But don't just upload infected
  WaReZ that people (probably) will download and eventually run. Instead 
  do something smarter, and more original! I've a few goodies up my 
  sleeve that we actively use and I want to share with you.
  
  The first one is really brilliant :-). Ever heard of a ASM infector? :-)
  Hehe. Okay, then, check this code out:
  
  ; ----------------- IMMORTAL RIOT ASM INFECTOR (GRIN) ------------------------
  
  ; Below is a dissassembly on the MAKE-UP-ONE-BBS-NAME! loader#1. Due to
  ; the close down on the mentioned board, I hereby give you the source-
  ; code, and my permission to alter it, use it, change the text, or 
  ; whatever. It's nice to include in the ZIP packets!
  ;
  ; I'm sorry that I can't release the pure-source of this lame little
  ; piece of shitty code, I lost it in one of my zillions HD-crashes.
  ; Although it's coded in pure ASM, the code still sucks. IMO of'cos!
  ;
  ; The code is hardly commented, but if you know assembly, you should
  ; be able to follow it, and if you're a non-programmer, just change the
  ; text in the "data_0005" and get your very own little loader!
  
  ; For getting this to an executable COM file write:
  ; tasm load#1.asm          ;Turbo Assembler Needed!
  ; tlink /t load#1.obj	     ;As well as tlink (duh!)

  Creating an ASM infector

  Well, for getting an "infected" ASM-file, all you gotta do is code
  a small, nice loader that you're sure people will use. Then, infect
  it with your latest virus and dissassemble the (now) infected loader.
  Then start to spread out the dissassembly of it in a package including
  the compiler, the linker (My experience is that most people don't have
  Tasm) as well as some nifty file_id.diz and .nfo file! This b'cos of
  "normal" people don't look in the ASM files if they're being 
  distributed as plain text files!
  
  Now, what's the problem with the above method?
  
  To the one's who know some assembly, the encrypted part (the virus) 
  of the intro looks really dumb! But write somewhere that it's some 
  sort of picture or data and you really hate the "include" command as 
  well as including external files. Problem number one solved!
  
  Then, you must also change the first jump (Heck, this jumps to LOC_12, 
  and that's not very normal!) to an ordinary "ascii-string". Those 
  annoying problems are now solved and I bet you'll see lotsa pd and 
  elite boards using your loader! Relax, smile and have a great laugh 
  at them, when they spread your virus around! :)
  
  More ways of spreading
  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
  Another good thing concerning the spreading is nearly the same.
  Call up a board, yell for the sysop, and ask for some "AxX" (access).
  They will (of'cos) ask you if you can upload some hot stuff to their
  board first (They're all so fucking greedy!) and then, you'll receive
  AXX!! (great, huh? Laugher!)
  
  Now, you got 굆! Tell them that you have a high phone-bill and can't 
  trade as much as you want to (Yeh, right!) but instead, you can do 
  other work for their board! For example a bbs-loader! Sure he tell you,
  and bang! This sysop is being a virus-spreader (haha!). Then, one thing
  to remember is if this: If they trace you, deny everything! There's
  nothing they can do about it, b'cos digital evidence doesn't count in
  the court! Sure, they can sue you, but go figure who will win? Smile!
  
  Getting the lamers
  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
  Ok, one more way of spreading your virus... just dial a board up,
  post a hex-script in the a programming net (Creative Demo Net for
  instance), describe it as a new, fucking awesome demo routine that is
  3 time faster than the one created by Future Crew! ...and if they
  find it good, then they are welcome to receive the source code to
  it. But what they don't know is that you've placed a G "go" at the end
  of the hex-script :). Heh. The virus is run on their computer and
  then they just say "Ah, what a lamer, this routine sucks!". Now, he's
  infected and so is the rest of the people on that meeting. Fun, right?
  
  Creating publicity
  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
  Ok. However, the best way of spreading viruses is naturally to infect
  big schools (Lehigh, Chalmers, MIT, is good examples!) pd-disk-
  distributors (like Tequila) and send infected programs on Internet.
  
  Well, actually a combination on all above spreading methods is surely
  the best best way to create total chaos!! So, quit this Mr.Nice.Guy
  image now, start to create destructive/malicious viruses and by darn,
  spread them!
