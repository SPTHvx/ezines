                          IR for the future
                          =================
  
  Well. How does the future look alike? Ok. I'll soon move away for
  further studies in another city located in Sweden. But since it's 
  an education in which you use a computer a whole lot, I'll most likely 
  continue with this kinda things. And beside that, I'll also receive an 
  Internet account and I'll as well try to set up an Internet connected 
  BBS. So, I will not be in the dark, if that's what you thought!!
  
  Raver
  컴컴
  Raver's military duty will soon end, so I guess he's going to have a 
  bit more time for computers. However, as he's reading quite an hard
  eduction, is partying a lot, you never know how the time will be 
  prioritied (Heck, we actually got lifes!)
  
  The young guys
  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
  Then, both Metal Militia and B-Real will be reading some technical 
  shit in a school located in their current city.. So, I guess they 
  will be doing what they always has.
  
  Immortal Riot
  컴컴컴컴컴컴
  But how does it look for our group? Well. I hope it remain as stable
  as it's now as well as we continue to release our magazine's. Well,
  why shouldn't we? I know all members in a private matter and will not
  break up with 굆 b'cos I meet some other/new friends! No way! So.. I 
  guess we all will be doing what we always have!
  
  Carpe Diem
  컴컴컴컴컴
  But you never know.. I might get a russian nuclear missile right in my 
  head, be burned by KBG or I might even die b'cos of an extremly fat 
  eskimoe falled out from his airplane and landed on me. So, seize the
  day, and don't think about the "day tommorow!". What happens, happens.
