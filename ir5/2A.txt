  General Info>

  Okey, this is a good dissassembly of the virus called Maaike.250, that
  circulated around on the boards in the file RAUSER.COM, which was 
  described as an utility to hack any remote access board. Funny isn't 
  it? Doesn't those board-crashers deserve to get infected? Well, I
  most certainly think they do!

  But those loosers are really funny! They contacted the a-v persons and
  cried out "Help me! I got virus infected when I thought about hacking 
  boards!" Puke! So, what did I do about it? Heh. Of'cos taking advantages
  about all the "wanna-be hackers" dreams.

  Well, I as well released such a program, described in the 
  file_id.diz  as:

   ***********************************************************
   *** PROGRAM ABOUT HOW TO GET FULL-REMOTE-ACCESS CONTROL ***
   *** OVER *MOST* OF THE BBS-PROGRAMS USED TODAY!         ***   
   *** INCLUDES: EVL/PCE/PCB/SBBS/RA/OBV AND MUCH MORE!	   ***
   *** (C) 1994 SWEDISH LIBERATION FRONT!		   ***
   ***********************************************************

  ..and naturally enough we got quite a few reports concerning
  infected computers as well as trashed harddrives :). The first was sent 
  by Daniel Prember on Swe.vir so therefor we decided to nominate this 
  person as the winner of Immortal Riot's "hacker-wanna-be" award! 
  Congratulation! (Yeh, I did mimic NuKE IJ#5, but this is our fifth 
  journal, so.. :) )

  Anyhow, back to the Maiike.250 virus!

  Function>
  This virus will go resident with an int27h routine (TSR), taking 816 
  bytes in memory (you can see it with a mem /c). When you execute an 
  EXE-program,it'll drop itself as a hidden .COM file with the same name 
  as the EXE-file. This will result in the COM program running first. 
  It's encrypted, and uses a neat routine for getting the XOR-value. 
  However, it can be detected with a simple scan-string.

  The Int27h problem>
  When you re-boot the computer, and trow the virus out from the
  memory and later run an "infected" EXE (i.e the com-program), the virus
  will just go memory resident, without running the EXE-program. But when
  you 2 seconds later run the file again, it'll work just normally. So,
  no big deal really, but easily detected.

  Important Note>
  For getting this to a com file write:
  Tasm /m2 Maaike.asm ˛ Tlink /t Maaike.obj

 Comment +
  What these few lines of code above really do is (nothing) that they
  move a few bytes to another place in virus where the data is the 
  same as the value we're moving. In other words, they are some lines 
  that really doesn't do anything and they are there probably only 
  because the author of the virus (maaike? :) want to make the life 
  of av-producers a bit harder but it seems like he haven't succed... +
