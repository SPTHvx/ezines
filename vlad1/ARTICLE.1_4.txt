                                                                              
    As you may have figured we are just about a two person team, excluding
our newest member Prone who hasn't had enough time to get anything in yet
but hopefully you should see something from him in the next magazine :)

    Here's the members at the moment:

    Metabolis :: Leader
                 At the moment I do all the ansis but as you can see,
                 I'm not very good at it :).  Wouldn't mind someone
                 who can do em tho.. hint hint hehe.  I also try to
                 keep things running, but it isn't too successful.

    Qark      :: Coder
                 Qark has done every piece of code (just about) in
                 the whole magazine.  Need someone to take a little
                 of the stress off him.  Thinks he's a legend.. but
                 hey.. you get that sometimes.

    Prone     :: Articles/Coder
                 Prone is a learning coder so eventually something
                 might come out of it but we'll see :).  He's pretty
                 politically motivated so I'm sure he'll have something
                 to say about that hehe.

    Well that's the lot of us, perhaps there'll be more for the next
magazine, who knows.  At least I hope so!  Someone out there has to be
motivated enough.
