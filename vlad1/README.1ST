
 Welcome to the first VLAD magazine!

 A few things about the magazine.  When you load it there's a VGA piccy that
 Qark quickly whipped up.  If you don't have a monitor capable of showing
 this (apart from buying a new one) just stick *anything* on the command line
 and it won't display it.

 The magazine takes up 500k of memory, so make sure you have plenty of
 memory available :)
