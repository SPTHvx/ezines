					<h2><span class="header">DLL Hijacking in antiviruses</span></h2>
					<br>
					<p class="text">Hey there!</p>
					<p class="text">We are going to talk about <span class="warning">DLL Hijacking</span> 
here (with examples of this attack) in the context of antiviruses. This text represents observations and should be considered as such. Obviously, if this information is all too simple and familiar to you, let's call it a beginner guide =)</p>
					<p class="text"><span class="warning">DLL Hijacking</span> - is referred to as DLL substitution. Many programs, when calling the LoadLibrary(char *) function, transmit the file name as a parameter, rather than the full way to it. That way, you can substitute one library being uploaded for any other one. This has to do with the search of the DLL beginning in the directory that contains the calling EXE-file. In this case the substituted DLL is launched with the same privileges as the running process.</p>
					<p class="text">For AV, like for any other software, this attack technique can (and should) be used. Clearly, as a result of a successful attack, our code is working in a proxy application, has the same privileges and can do whatever it wants.</p> 
					<p class="text">So letís divide AVs by self-defense into 2 groups:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>those that donít protect themselves (directories/files/processes/windows/register/attributes/etc; partial protection (for example, file protection or protection of just the register etc) does not count); </li>
						<li>those trying to do it. </li>
					</ul>

					<p class="text">For instance, <span class="warning">Comodo</span> (AV/IS v5.10) belongs to the first group. (Unfortunately), applications that are not in the proxy list canít harm any data in the AVís folder so easily. However, itís possible to copy your files there. While superficially analyzing some of the Comodo's components, I discovered a significant number of  LoadLibrary calls for files missing from the specified directory (and the entire axis as well). All we need to do is upload our own library with a specific name in the required folder and enjoy the result (a restart may be needed). 
For example, we have the following directory: </p>

					<p class="warning">"C:\Program Files\COMODO\COMODO Internet Security\themes\"</p>
					
					<p class="text">(default path) ñ comodo keeps tonalities there, which represent life PE-files:</p>

<p class="text">This library wasnít found in this whole OS with default AVís settings. </p>
<p class="text">We can bypass nod32 in this way: </p>
<ul>
<li>[1] set your dll name as "ppeset.dll" and copy it to the %TEMP% folder; </li>
<li>[2] in the system variable ìPathî add %TEMP% directory;</li>
<li>[x] or just copy the library to the system folder and forget about the register; </li>
</ul>	
<p class="text">After restarting the system, our library will be added, it will call the function <span class="warning">DllRegisterServer()</span> and unload from the address area (AA) of the "ekrn.exe" process.</p>

<p class="text">Thereís one more thing: if any of the AV processes created, say, a dialog box to open files ("Open"/"Save"/etc), then we can move our files through this dialog box even to directories protected by antivirus (<span class="warning">"Action Via Window" attack</span> - why the hell not). Such dialog boxes are created with the help of GetOpenFileName / GetSaveFileName functions, which belong to the ìComdlg32.dllî library. This library is running in the AA process of AV, which is considered to be a proxy and has admin rights or higher.</p> 

<p class="text">The algorithm of running this attack can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>[1] launch our process; </li> 
<li>[2] monitor windows for a dialog box to open the files;</li>
<li>[3] when this dialog box appears, we will know which process it belongs to and will know its current folder;</li>
<li>[4] if the current directory is what we needed (AVís protected folder), we should check if our file (with a specific name) is there. Found it? ñ Ok, now get to point [6], otherwise - [5]. If the current directory doesnít match ñ then you need point [2];</li>
<li>[5] copy/move your file to Clipboard (CB), run the dialog box found and press "Ctrl + V";</li>
<li>[6] our program is shutting down;</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">Itís all great, but many of the moves mentioned above will most certainly not run on Windows
Vista / 7 because of the <span class="warning">fucking UAC.</span>. </p>
	
<p class="text">As you know, when the uac is enabled, most applications will launch with default user rights  (even if the user works from an admin account). You can't really change various system parameters (copying / pasting / etc the file to system directory, changing the environment variables of the system, injects into the processes and / or transferring window messages to them <span class="warning">(UIPI protection)</span> with higher <span class="warning">Integrity Level</span> etc etc - all that is unavailable). </p>
<p class="text">The most obvious solution is to  upgrade the rights related to bypassing controls. </p>
<p class="text">So, bypass can be divided into 2 types: active (uac dialog box does not appear) and passive (does appear). </p> 

<p class="text">The following will belong to the active type: </p>
<ul>
<li>exploits;</li>
<li>(possible) injects into processes;</li>
<li>Some other specific features (for example, the well-known manipulation with the "IFileOperation" interface ); </li>
</ul>
<p class="text">Passive type: </p>
<ul>
<li>our application name must contain any of the following lines: "install", "setup", "update",
"patch" (application loader heuristics will start, and our program will request a privilege upgrade upon launch);</li>
<li>we make a special manifest in the application (etc + manifest documents to upgrade the rights);</li>
<li>pain in the ass for the user: check their privileges, and if they are low - run themselves with upgraded rights (ShellExecute (Ex) with the "run as" command) until the user goes mad from all the  dialog windows (finally allowing us to work with required privileges);</li>
<li>once launched, our program will download any signed installer / update / etc (usually such an update is analyzed in advance for a attack dll hijack attack), adds the already prepared dll with a specific name and stuffed with goodies, then runs the downloaded file.  
(Usually) if the user confirms the launch of such an update, it will run with upgraded privileges, as well as our dll;</li>
<li>once launched, our program monitors the appearance of new processes. If such a process is found, we locate its file, analyze it and make the dll hijack happen (as an option, you can monitor "Consent.exe" before a new process). Another option is to change your file name to the name of the new process and run it with upgraded privileges;</li>
<li>use the clipboard in the hope that the file gets to the required location;</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">It's pretty clear that in a generic case, an active attack is more efficient: we make a breach and make stuff happen. However, a passive one also has pretty good chances ñ we will never teach users to read =)</p>

<p class="warning">As you see, everything is possible, just go for it! </p>

<p class="text">---</p>

<ul>
<li>there are ready-made tools for detecting vulnerable applications in the system (for example, 
         <span class="warning">"DllHijackAuditKit"</span>). Plus, we can make a couple of extra TOOLS for more accurate qualitative analysis of specific files / processes / etc (search by strings, code, etc); </li>
<li>source codes from the examples can be found in the <a href="sources/pr0mix/dllhijack" target="_blank">dllhijack</a> 
(before launching the programs, please read comments in the source code); </li>
<li>all tests were run on Win XP/Vista/7 x86 with the default settings of all AVs. </li>
