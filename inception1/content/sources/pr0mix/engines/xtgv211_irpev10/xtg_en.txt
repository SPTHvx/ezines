USER'S MANUAL

Here we consider engines: RANG32, FAKA, XTG, iRPE (rang32.asm, faka.asm, xtg.inc, xtg.asm, logic.asm, 
irpe.asm). You can combine them into one big engine, and used separately.  
Examples work of engines look in test.asm (+ test.bat). 
Remarks, suggestions, requests are welcome=)
Also, I'd be grateful, if You, finding inaccuracies in work of the engines, let Me know.
And sorry for my bad english =)

xTG
eXperimental/eXtended/eXecutable Trash Generator
xtg.inc, xtg.asm, logic.asm	
=========================================================================================================
PROTOTYPE:
stdcall: DWORD xTG(DWORD xparam);
xparam - address of the filled structure XTG_TRASH_GEN. After performing this function:
	1. trash-code will be generated;
	2. output fields of the structure XTG_TRASH_GEN will be filled; 
	3. in EAX - address for further entries of trash-code; 
=========================================================================================================
NOTES:
[+] input fields of structure XTG_TRASH_GEN (and all other structures) after working off the engine 
	don't change their values; 
[+] if the structures (XTG_TRASH_GEN etc) will change (add new fields, etc), then make the size of 
	these structures are a multiple of 4 (x86); 
[+] see source code (ssc) =)
[+] this engine consists of files: xtg.inc, xtg.asm, logic.asm. xtg.inc - header file. xtg.asm - 
	engine the xTG. logic.asm - logic of trash; 
[+] xTG designed to generate trash instructions and data (strings, numbers, etc). Can be used as a 
	stand-alone engine and together with any other engine: polymorph, permutant etc. Can use to viruses/
	worms/trojans/etc, cryptors, protectors, packers and other progs; 
=========================================================================================================
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE FIELDS OF STRUCTURES:
[0] - input param;
[1] - output param;
	 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	  
XTG_TRASH_GEN
Main structure. 

[fmode]					: [0]
						  Trash-Code generation mode. The engine has 2 modes of generation of garbage:
						  XTG_MASK и XTG_REALISTIC. 
						  1-st mode, XTG_MASK aka "mask" - you can select and generate specific 
						  instructions (using a mask). It may be useful for slow-polymorphism. 
						  2-nd mode, XTG_REALISTIC aka "realistic". This mode generates the "right" code 
						  that tries to be as similar to a conventional code of standard programs 
						  (written in HLL). To do this, instructions are built now correctly: opcodes 
						  (adaptive to the ms-compilers), constructions, uses opcode frequency 
						  statistics, building of a logic code, and more.
						  Use your favorite mode!
						  if you specify a mode XTG_MASK and selected, for example, 2-3 instructions in 
						  the mask, the engine may be slow to create trash - wait and all will be. It is 
						  a norm; 
						  
[rang_addr]				: [0]
						  RNG address. You can pass the RANG32 address or any other RNG. Then the 
						  function prototype RNG should be:
						  (stdcall) DWORD xRandNumGen (DWORD n);
						  This function should return (in EAX) random number (RN) in the range 
						  [0..n - 1]. Registers (except EAX) after the call should remain unchanged.
						  
[faka_addr]				: [0]
						  address of the Fake Api Generator (FAG). You can pass the FAKA address or any 
						  other FAG. Then the function prototype FAG should be:
						  (stdcall) DWORD xGenFakeApi(DWORD xaddr); 
						  xaddr - the address on the structure identical to these FAKA_FAKEAPI_GEN.
						  This function should return an address for further write code. 
						  If the generation of winapi-func you don't need, then here you can put 0;
						  
[faka_struct_addr]		: [0]
						  address of the structure FAKA_FAKEAPI_GEN. This structure needed for work 
						  of the engine FAKA in xTG.
						  Also, if the generation of winapi-func you don't need, then here you can 
						  put 0; 
						  
[xfunc_struct_addr]		: [0]
						  address of the structure XTG_FUNC_STRUCT. 
						  If the function (with prologues, etc.) are created by this engine (xTG, 
						  mode "realistic", flag XTG_FUNC etc), then you can write in this field a 0. 
						  If the functions are  don't created, then this is safely possible put 0.  
						  In other situations, then fill XTG_FUNC_STRUCT-structure and pass its address 
						  in this field;
						  
[xdata_struct_addr]		: [0]
						  address of the structure XTG_DATA_STRUCT. 
						  If you need a creation of instructions such as 
						  mov ecx, dword ptr [403008h] etc, and/or generation of thrash-data (strings, 
						  numbers), then fill this structure and its address is passed in this field. 
						  If such instructions are not needed, then this field = 0;
						  
[xlogic_struct_addr]	: [0]
						  адрес of the structure XTG_LOGIC_STRUCT (xtg.inc). In this field, pass the 
						  address only when the engine xTG called multiple times, and thus it is 
						  necessary to inherit the logic generated by the trash code. In other 
						  situations, boldly set 0.
						  To inherit the logic it is done so:
						  - first (before call xTG) call let_init (find in logic.asm);
						  - then call xTG as many times as you want by passing in a given field value 
						  received in return let_init 
						  (xlogic_struct_addr = let_init(...));
						  - and then call let_end (logic.asm); 
						  
[icb_struct_addr]		: [0]
						  address of memory (buffer), where are placed filled structure 
						  IRPE_CONTROL_BLOCK_STRUCT, and at once behind it of structure 
						  IRPE_BLOCK_DATA_STRUCT. These structures allow  to write together with 
						  generated garbage some "useful" code (convenient recording, for example, of 
						  decryptor, anti-emulate etc, which can be scattered on functions and is 
						  stirred by a logical realistic garbage code (all optional)). 
						  If you want only the generation of trash-code, then this field = 0.
						  If you want details, I'll add a description of these structures. 
						  
[alloc_addr]			: [0] 
						  address the function of memory allocation. It is desirable to pass the 
						  address, then the engine will use its capabilities to 100%.
						  Prototype memory allocation function:
						  (stdcall) DWORD xFuncAlloc(DWORD xsize);
						  This function must allocate memory for the read-write-execute, and return (in 
						  EAX) address of the allocated memory, the size of xsize bytes. After the 
						  call, registers (except EAX) should remain unchanged. 
						  As an alternative, in this field, you can pass 0;
						  
[free_addr]				: [0]
						  address of a function to free memory. It is desirable to pass the 
						  address, then the engine will use its capabilities to 100%; etc; 
						  Prototype function to free memory:
						  (stdcall) DWORD/void xFuncFree(xaddr);
						  This function must to free memory on address xaddr. After the call, registers 
						  should remain unchanged.
						  
[tw_trash_addr]			: [0]
						  the address where to write the generated trash;
						  
[trash_size]			: [0]
						  size of trash-code; 
						  
[xmask1] & [xmask2]		: [0]
						  64-bit mask for the generation of trash (for XTG_MASK/XTG_REALISTIC mode). 
						  See in xtg.inc for details.
						  Btw, flag XTG_FUNC can be used, if 
						  [fmode] = "realistic", 
						  [alloc_addr] = FuncMemAlloc;
						  [free_addr] = FuncMemFree;
						  and all other fields are correctly filled out=);
						  Btw, flag XTG_LOGIC can be used analogically; 
						  
[fregs]					: [0]
						  busy registers. See in xtg.inc for details; etc; 
						  For correctly work of the engine should be left free for at least 3 32-bit 
						  registers. But we can left free and less 3 - if are generated by specific 
						  instructions - everything on situation.
						  If busy registers - this XTG_EAX + XTG_ECX + XTG_EDX. And also, have flag 
						  to create a winapi-func. Then this registers are all the same may change its 
						  values. So be careful!
						  Also, ebp & esp registers are always busy and do not change their values 
						  after working off of trash-code. 
						  
[nobw]					: [1]
						  number of bytes written. 
						  If [fmode] = XTG_REALISTIC, then [nobw] = [trash_size];
						  
[ep_trash_addr]			: [1]
						  entry point in the created trash. 
						  If [fmode] = XTG_MASK, then [ep_trash_addr] = [tw_trash_addr]. 
						  If [fmode] = XTG_REALISTIC without flag XTG_FUNC (xmask), then 
						  [ep_trash_addr] = [tw_trash_addr]. 
						  If [fmode] = XTG_REALISTIC and in xmask set flag XTG_FUNC, then 
						  [ep_trash_addr] = address of the function at which to begin work trash-code;
						  
[fnw_addr]				: [1]
						  address for further writing code; 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
XTG_FUNC_STRUCT
The structure required to create functions (with a prologue, epilogue etc). Also read about
XTG_GEN_TRASH.xfunc_struct_addr.

[func_addr]				: [0]
						  address of function. At this address will be generated (or already built) func 
						  (with a prologue etc); 
						  
[func_size]				: [0]
						  size of this function; 
						  
[call_num]				: [0]
						  number of calls (0xE8) in this function; 
						  
[local_num]				: [0]
						  number of local variables in function. For example, there is instruction 
						  sub esp, 0Ch - then the number of local variables = 0Ch (12) / 4 = 3 
						  ([local_num] = 3); 
						  
[param_num]				: [0]
						  number of input parameters in the function. 
						  For example, there is construction: 
							push	ecx							;input param
							push	dword ptr [ebp - 04]		;input param
							call	func_x
						  Then for function func_x field [param_num] = 2; 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
XTG_DATA_STRUCT
The structure required to create instructions that use memory addresses, as well as to generate 
trash-data: strings, numbers, etc. Also read about XTG_TRASH_GEN.xdata_struct_addr.

[xmask]					: [0]
						  mask to generate trash-data. 
						  If you need to create only instructions that use memory addresses, then write 
						  0 here. Also, see in xtg.inc; 
						  
[rdata_addr]			: [0]
						  address, where will be written trash-data; 
						  in this field can be passed as VirtualAddress (VA), and the absolute 
						  physical address in the file (for writing to a file);
						  If [rdata_addr] = 0, then trash-data is not generated.
						  This address is transmitted only for the generation of thrash-data!
						  For trash-code, these addresses can be read-only.
						  Areas addresses 
						  [rdata_addr] + [rdata_size] 
						  [xdata_addr] + [xdata_size]
						  don't must overlap! 
						  it is desirable to address ([rdata_addr]) a multiple of 4;
						  
[rdata_size]			: [0]
						  size of this area, and the value must be >= 4 (bytes); 
						  
[rdata_pva]				: [0]
						  what the address is passed in [rdata_addr]: VA or physical? Availables values 
						  for this field can be found in xtg.inc; 
						  
[xdata_addr]			: [0]
						  address of memory - the address of this area will be used the generated 
						  instructions such as 
						  add ecx, dword ptr [403008h] 
						  sub dword ptr [40300Ch], edx 
						  and others;
						  in this field is passed to VA; 
						  it is desirable to address ([xdata_addr]) a multiple of 4; 
						  
[xdata_size]			: [0]
						  size of this area, and the value must be >= 4 (bytes); 
						  
[nobw]					: [1]
						  number of bytes written of trash-data. 
						  If trash-data are not generated, then this field is ignored; 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAKA_FAKEAPI_GEN
The structure for FAKA (and for XTG_TRASH_GEN.faka_struct_addr). 

[mapped_addr]			: [0]
						  result of function MapViewOfFile; 
						  
[rang_addr]				: [0]
						  RNG address. Also, see a field XTG_TRASH_GEN.rang_addr; 
						  
[alloc_addr]			: [0]
						  also, see a field XTG_TRASH_GEN.alloc_addr;
						  
[free_addr]				: [0]
						  also, see a field XTG_TRASH_GEN.free_addr; 
						  
[xfunc_struct_addr]		: [0]
						  also, see a field XTG_TRASH_GEN.xfunc_struct_addr (in FAKA - for 
						  push dword ptr [ebp - 14] etc (param for winapi)); 
						  
[xdata_struct_addr]		: [0]
						  also, see a field XTG_TRASH_GEN.xdata_struct_addr (in FAKA - for 
						  push dword ptr [403008h] etc (param for winapi)); 
						  
[tw_api_addr]			: [0]
						  the address where to write the generated fake call winapi.
						  If the engine FAKA is used inside the engine xTG, then you can write in this 
						  field 0.
						  If the winapi-func is not found, then nothing in that buffer will not be 
						  writed; 
						  
[api_size]				: [0]
						  max size of winapi-construction. Winapi-construction, for example, this:
							push	0
							push	403000h
							push	403000h
							push	0
							call	MessageBoxA
						  If the engine FAKA is used inside the engine xTG, then you can write in this 
						  field 0 (also, see xtg.inc (value WINAPI_MAX_SIZE)); 
						  
[api_hash]				: [0] [1]
						  Search winapi (more precisely VA) occurs on hash of name of the necessary 
						  winapi. If this field != 0, then it (FAKA) will search only this winapi-func, 
						  the hash on whose behalf specified. And if winapi is found in the file that 
						  mapped in memory, then in the [api_va] return VirtualAddress (VA in IAT), in 
						  which will be address of interest us winapi. If the specified hash was in 
						  hashes-table (see in FAKA), then will be generated and written to the buffer 
						  ([tw_api_addr]) fake call of found winapi-function. If the hash was not in 
						  the hash-table, then the generation will not be. It can be done manually 
						  (using the address in [api_va]).
						  If this field = 0, then will search any hash from hash-table (about fake call 
						  alreafy written). 
						  If winapi is found, regardless, will generate call or not, this 
						  field = hash on behalf of the found winapi-func. If winapi is not found, 
						  then there will be 0; 
						  
[api_va]				: [1]
						  If winapi is found, then this field = VA, in which will be address of interest 
						  us winapi. If winapi is not found, then there will be 0; 
						  
[nobw]					: [1]
						  number of bytes (actually) written; 
						  
[fnw_addr]				: [1]
						  address for further write code;

The main structure. 

[xmask]					: [0]
						  32-bit mask for polymorph.

						  be generate multiple nested decryptors (multiple decryptor layers generation).
						  
[xtg_struct_addr]		: [0]
						  address of the structure XTG_TRASH_GEN (or any other similar). This structure 
						  is needed for working of trash generator (xTG etc) inside polymorphic engine. 
						  
[xtg_addr]				: [0]
						  address of the engine TrashGen (xTG or any other similar). 
						  
[code_addr]				: [0]
						  address of code, which must be encrypted. And, specifically the code at this 
						  address will not be changed.
						  
[va_code_addr]			: [0]
						  virtual address (VA), on which in the future will be placed encrypted code for 
						  further decryption (and starting). 
						  
[code_size]				: [0] 
						  size of code that must be encrypted. 

[decryptor_size]		: [0]
						  size of decryptor. If [decryptor_size] < DECRYPTOR_MIN_SIZE, then decryptor is 
						  not generated. If use multiple-decryptor's, then size of every 
						  decryptor = [decryptor_size]. It's normal. 
						  
[decryptor_addr]		: [1]
						  address of created decryptor. 
						  iRPE engine allocates memory (buffer) to store the generated decryptor and 
						  encrypted code. Moreover, at the beginning of this memory is decryptor, and 
						  right behind him is an encrypted code. Therefore, when this memory block is no 
						  longer needed, it can be free (address = [decryptor_addr], size = [total_size]). 
							
[encrypt_code_addr]		: [1]
						  address of encrypted code. 
						  The code for encryption is copied to the selected (in iRPE) buffer and in him 
						  encrypted. This code is located at once for decryptor. 
						  
[total_size]			: [1]
						  the total size of generated decryptor + encrypted code.
						  общий размер созданного декриптора + зашифрованного кода. 
						  The size of the encrypted code, you can find, like so:
						  enc_code_size = total_size - decryptor_size; 
						  
[ep_polymorph_addr]		: [1]
						  entry point in polymorphic decryptor. 
						  точка входа в сгенерированный полиморфный декриптор. That is, with this address 
						  starts work a polymorphic decryptor (This address is located, naturally, in the 
						  range [decryptor_addr..encrypt_code_addr);). 
						  
[leave_num]				: [1]
						  the number - how many times to execute a leave-instruction, to balance a stack.
						  Polymorphic decryptor adapts under a code of usual programs: has functions, 
						  etc.
						  If in [xmask] set flag IRPE_CALL_DECRYPTED_CODE, then will be "call" of 
						  decrypted code in one of functions decryptor. And, accordingly, the stack will 
						  be a variety of data. And so, just also it is necessary for its balancing this 
						  field. 
						  However, the field is in most cases can be ignored.

FEATURES:
[+] generates polymorphic decryptor and encryption of code;
[+] realistic (starter) decryptor;
[+] generates random registers;
[+] generates random keys for encryption/decryption; 
[+] different size of decryptor (set); 
[+] decryptor instructions have "synonyms";
[+] changing the order of between some of the instructions;
[+] changing the order of the call between certain instructions;
[+] use of the RNG and TreshGen (fucking super theme + logical trash tech); 
[+] several algorithms for encryption/decryption (add/sub/xor);
