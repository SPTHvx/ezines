
The Boza Situation by Quantum / VLAD
------------------------------------

On the 29th of January 1996 I was directed to an article at
http://www.sophos.com about the "world's first win95 virus".  Although
the article stated that the virus was written in Australia - it did not
state by whom the virus was written, and even though vlad was mentioned
(the new object created by Bizatch is ".vlad") it does not actually
state we wrote it.

While I was investigating the appearance, I had this conversation with the
#antivirus moderator, Hermanni:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> *hermanni* you conscious ?
<Hermanni> yeah.
-> *hermanni* I dont know you.. and I doubt you know me.. but I hear you are
   rather well known in the AV community
*Hermanni* no, i don't think i know you.
-> *hermanni* neways.. do you happen to know a guy by the name of Paul
   Ducklin ?  AVer with a group called Sophos.. ?
*Hermanni* yes, i know paul. duck@sophos.com
-> *hermanni* ok.. he has written an article and had it placed on the sophos
   www site.. it is about the worlds first win95 virus..
-> *hermanni* I wrote this virus and I have mailed him at that address to
   tell him this and I have gotten no reply -> *hermanni* you see.. he has
   plucked a name for the virus out of the air he calls it "boza" .. even
   tho there are massive ascii strings in it clearly stating that the virus
   is called "bizatch"
-> *hermanni* eg Please note: the name of this virus is [Bizatch] written by
   Quantum of VLAD
-> *hermanni* rather annoying..
*Hermanni* yes, we're calling to 'Boza' as well. it's a good name.
-> *hermanni* it's NOT a good name.. where did you get "boza" from ?!!?
*Hermanni* well, we called it _3192 for some time, then somebody thought
           'Boza' would be more descriptive.
*Hermanni* i believe solomon and mcafee are calling it Boza as well.
-> *hermanni* calling it boza is not in your best interests.. paul ducklin is
-> *hermanni* going to look rather silly when vlad 6 comes out and it is
-> *hermanni* painfully obvious that the name was made up and the true name
-> *hermanni* was in the middle of the virus.. did you all even look for
-> *hermanni* strings ?
*Hermanni* hey, the name has already been decided.
*Hermanni* too late to complain, i'm afraid.
*Hermanni* do you have any idea how painful it is to get all the antivirus
           venders to change a name of a virus?
-> *hermanni* no.. the name was chosen when I wrote the virus.. the name was
   choosen when it escaped from our test systems and spread to every fewl who
   copies win95 executables..
-> *hermanni* are you aware of how annoying it is to sit and choose a virus
   name only to have it ignored by AV "researchers" ?
<Hermanni> too bad, i gotta go
<Hermanni> chat with you another time.
<Hermanni> bye
<QuantumG> fine.. perhaps Virus Bulletin Magazine will do a better job
<QuantumG> and if they do.. on your square head be it

Generally, I think anti-virus authors need to adopt a much more professional 
attitude.

Contrary to Paul Ducklin's claims, he (and Sophos) were not the first
antivirus company to discover this virus.  It seems that AVP was the
first to "discover" it:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Win95.Boza
     
     It is not a dangerous parasitic NewEXE(PE)-virus. It searches for
     EXE-files, checks the files for PE signature, then creates in
     EXE-file new section named ".vlad", and writes its code into that
     section.
     
     While infecting that virus uses calls to functions GetDir, SetDir,
     FindFirst, FindNext, OpenFile, LSeek, Read, Write, and CloseFile.
     First, it gets the current directory, and checks the Windows95
     kernel for some specific code. Then the virus searches for
     .EXE-files, and checks them for PE signature. Then the virus
     increases NumberOfSections field in PE-header, writes into the file
     new Section Header that describes new Section in the file, and
     writes itself to the end of the file.
     
     While executing the virus infects up to 3 files, and looks for
     .EXE-files in parent directories, if there are no more .EXE-files in
     the current one. Before return to the host program the virus
     restores the current directory.
     
     The virus checks some data (the system date?) and in some cases
     displays the messages:

 Bizatch by Quantum / VLAD
 The taste of fame just got tastier!
 VLAD Australia does it again with the world's first Win95 Virus
 From the old school to the new..
 Metabolis
 Qark
 Darkman
 Automag
 Antigen
 RhinceWind
 Quantum
 Absolute Overlord
 CoKe

     The virus also contains the internal text strings:

 .vlad
 Please note: the name of this virus is [Bizatch] written by Quantum of VLAD

     The virus is not bugs-free, and in some cases Windows95 displays the
     error message while executing of infected EXE-files.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The claim of bugs in the virus are not without reason.  There ARE bugs
in the "Boza" virus.  As stated - Boza is a beta of Bizatch.  The bugs
are fixed in the final release (thus the word beta!).

(Quantum made a slight error here in the first release of vlad#6,
 on behalf of him, I'd like to apologise to Sara Gordon.  In the
 future he will make sure he confirms any information he receives.)

Looking through the alt.comp.virus news area, Metabolis came across a posting
by Vesselin Bontchev.  He has replied to it and I will include that reply
here:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

What you anti virus people have, is a beta of our virus.  We gave it to 
a couple of people to test for us, and all of a sudden you guys seem to
have the source.  Leaking source to you would be the last thing I'd do.

Indeed, yet another media scare which will make you anti virus people a 
lot of money, I mean come on.. stop complaining.  We line your pockets.

Well gee, I wonder why the virus is buggy.. it's a beta!!  Not supposed 
to be released.  You'll have to wait for the magazine to get the full 
release.  As for it being silly, well.. do you see any others around?  We 
had to start somewhere..

Do you guys have anything better to be doing other than spiting virus 
authors?

Levski would like to code a virus I'm sure, but at this moment in time
writing anything in asm would be an impossibility.  Mainly because he
isn't a coder.  Next time you want to accuse someone of something, get
your facts straight first.

Bontchev, as of most AVers, has a high opinion of himself.  Giving a virus
multiple names will only confuse people who have the misfortune of coming
in contact with it.  Whoever released this beta of a virus into the wild
was very irresponsible - what's worse is they humiliated me in front of the
VX and AV community.  You have gained yourself at least one enemy.

Here is the beta of Bizatch (the actual virus code) that AV authors
around the world are calling "Boza".
