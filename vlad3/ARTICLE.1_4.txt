    +-------------+

    Well there has been a little more action in the ranks of VLAD since
    the last issue.  We now have two new members, the first based in
    America and Rhincewind in a mystery country.  There are
    contributions from all of us in this issue so things are coming
    together as a group.

    There is one other author who is at the moment in the process of
    trying to join so I'd say we pretty much have enough people in the
    group for now.  If you want to submit anything to us send it to
    us anyways and it will get put in if it's decent.

    (VLAD is still based in Australia ;)

    Each of us do the same sort of thing, i.e. code and write articles
    so it's not really worth putting in what we each do individually ;).
