    +---------------+

    At the moment we only have two dist sites for our magazine, if you
    want to join this small list then you can try a few methods of
    getting in touch with us.

    Well, we get CRISnet and NuKEnet although it seems sometimes that
    there is major problems with the feed that no one knows about :).
    Look for any of us on IRC in #virus, or email me (metabolis) at
    meta@tmok.res.wpi.edu

    Through internet you can get our magazine a few different ways,
    either ftp from
    ftp.netcom.com : /pub/br/bradleym/Zines/VLAD/vlad#1.zip <- (whatever)
    or see if lamerbot is in the #virus channel on irc and type
    /msg lamerbot get Zines/VLAD/vlad#1.zip

    Anyways, here's the list of BBSs you can get the all of our releases
    from..
