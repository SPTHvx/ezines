   All our members have improved in their skill level since VLAD#2 but
   we intend on getting even better!  Of the research projects mentioned
   in the last issue we completed two, that being the multipartite
   virus and accessing the hard disk using ports.  Here is the list of
   research projects we are thinking of:
   
        Windows Virus   -       We've been saying we will do this for
                                for ages but we will get around to it
                                eventually.
        VIP Engine      -       The VLAD Indefinite Polymorphic engine.
                                This has almost already been done, but
                                is not good enough to be worthy of release.
                                Still has some bugs.

   We won't necessarily do any of these for the next issue but we will sure
   look at them.
