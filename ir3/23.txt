  			HOW TO CONTACT US
  			=================
  
  Ahh, this boring article again!! Well, this seems to be kinda meaning-
  less. In our second issue, we had this huge "how to get in contact",
  article, and guess what? Not too many contacted us, they all asked
  The Jugde instead of e-mail us, how patetic!!
  
  First of all, I can tell you, that I speak on regular basis with The
  Jugde, (sysop on Firedoom Systems, IR Swedish HQ), but I don't give
  him all information about the future, and such anyway. You know, there
  is lotsa funnier things to discuss than boring release dates and such.
  
  Anyway, we'll not give out the number to Firedoom Systems, of the
  request of a person who shall remain anonymous (The Jugde himself!).
  Yes, he have trown out enough lamers, calling his system without any
  knowledge about what they're talking about. They just want to leech all
  of his wares and HPV stuff b'cos he as the only "elite-board" sysop 
  here in Sweden has got this kinda nice "disabled on all user system".
  
  Anyway, if you're living in Sweden, the number shouldn't be any problem
  to get. But he also got NUP and NUV, for maximal anti lamer protection.
  If you want the # badly, I'll give you one hint: Insane Reality #2..
  
  Then anyhow, we've managed to get some international boards too, more
  specific one in the United States Of America, and one in Australia.
  
  We, me and Metal Militia, can't (for the moment anyway), be reached
  at these boards, but I'm quite sure that our magazine's will be there.. 
  Big thanks goes out to The Flash for fixing with these boards..
  
  Okey, here you got the numbers anyway:
  
   BBS-Name:		 Number:       Sysop:	   Modem:
  
   Red Dawn 2 Enterprises  410-263-2258  Dark Image  DS16800   DIST SITE
   Destiny Stone ][        +61-92462553  RipMax      DS14400   DIST SITE
  
  I also would like to say hello and give my best to Dark Image and RipMax
  for making us international. The distance makes it quite hard for us to
  call your boards, sorry for this!! But who knows, we might call you in
  the future, until then, stay tuned, and keep up the faith..
