  			   ==========
  
  We got a few things included in this magazine, which can cause persons
  and computers great damage, but we can't be held responsible for any
  person getting struck with one of our viruses. If you wants to complain
  about us, feel free to do that, we'll gladly recieve your reports of
  infections that our viruses have caused, but then again, not be held
  responsible! It's still not illegal here in Sweden, nor any(?) other
  country to write viruses, and if you wanna try to prove that we have
  spread them go ahead! Bite me!
  
  If the magazine code has been modified, such as virus-infected, we
  can not be held responsible for any damage it may cause with you or
  your computer. Not saying that we've infected this magazine, or
  anything. This means..that you're reading at your own risk..
  
  If you are one of these wanna-be's who don't agree the rules I've
  written, go buy the cheapest slegde hammer, and simple destroy your
  your entire computer. Thank you.
