                   MOOSE - a new michelangelo affair ?
                   ===================================
  
  It has now gone about four months since the person(s) responsible for
  the computers on the campus of the Chalmers Technical Highschool made
  their decision to cry out in fear for what they thought was a resident
  polymorphic bootsector/.exe/.com/.sys infector. This was partly true
  (it actually infected exe's, com's & sys files), but it wasn't either
  resident, boot-sector infecting or polymorphic (haha! what a fuckup
  statement, geee.. :)) And besides that, the .sys-files hang..
  
  But the new information, didn't came from him, instead it came from
  John McAfee who had disassembled the virus, and except for the above,
  he came up with a few different strains, like MOOSE 30, 31 and 32,
  and on the .sys-files it overwrote the stack (the cause of the fuckups).
  It moved up-wards with the "dot-dot" style, and it might change a random
  byte in the infected file being executed, which can cause some chaos, if
  it hits "the right place(s)". This was done by taking a random address,
  as target. Later down in the text i will translate a message from Swedish
  to English concerning this MOOSE thing. This was anyhow all over each and
  everyone of them computers, so the guy must have spread it a bit.
  
  He also found (this time Lars Renman) that infections hadn't just occured
  there, but on students homecomp's aswell. (gee! just spread it in some
  lousy game and give it to *.* of them non-understanding geeks and *WOW!*
  
  Anyhow, when the latest F-PROT BULL arrived (BULL-210.???) there was some
  articles about the new laws and one ESPECIALLY for MOOSE.. This made me
  very suprised and that may change my mind about infecting others than the
  public PD-systems and such. Why not spread it like hell instead and make
  them people respect you, right? (now i'm not meaning to infect Chalmers
  but anyhow..)
  
  And as usually Patricia hasn't taken it with in VSUM, since she hates all
  non-americans/canadians. She also never includes viruses from people that
  has something against her way of making descriptions. (like us) Too bad
  that some people can't take critics.. They are LOOSERS.. I'm thinking of
  making a VSUM-virus, just to see if she takes it with or not. But that's
  lame, and she wouldn't write about it anyways. She thinks her think is
  the best, so i tell her this, that there's and old saying that dreamers
  has no chance, since the world kills them. Grow up Patricia! It's time
  for that now. Learn to program a bit, disassemble everything yourself,
  and start discussing things on the Inter and Fido nets. I have nothing
  against you in person, but your attitude makes me wanna puke! (gaaack!)
  
  Now, back to MOOSE. I don't understand why it has been given so much
  publicity.. so that's why i tried to get an interview with the "famouse"
  person that found it at first (the Reindeerman :)), but he seemed to be
  "out of state", so if it doesn't show up in this issue, i simply didn't
  caught him.
