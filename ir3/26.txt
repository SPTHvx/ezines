                The Swedish viruswriters hunt is on the move
                ============================================
  
  What have my sad eyes found now? Well, there's a new law coming up in a
  few months that will make viruswriting/spreading illegal. Ok, i under-
  stand the spreading, but the writing? That's what i see as a felony
  against the human rights, since you have rights to express yourself, say
  what you want to etc. in a democracy, a FREE country. But Sweden starts
  to (more and more) block the gates for us digital knights. Also Switzer-
  land has started out to follow Sweden in it's tracks.. Maybe this is a
  gift to the European Union (ex. EC) to get a faster membership for them
  who want's to, what do i know? Why should i get into jail for lets say
  4-5 years and pay 500.000$ just because some stupid "wanna-be" spread my
  virus to a nearby policestation, and wiped out their registers? That's
  his problem, not mine just because i made the thing. In that case arrest
  every legal or illegal producer of weapons cause they can only be used to
  kill people with, nothing else. They thing they can stop us by the above
  restrictions, but then more people will start. That's because illegal
  things are "cool" so to speak. Below are two examples of them laws.
  
      (SWEDEN's law)
  
      Whoever creates a computer program or program
      instructions constructed in such a way that they are
      capable of affecting data or the technical equipment used
      to process data without having authorization to do so
          
      or
          
      spreads the aforementioned programs or instructions, and
      thus causes a risk of data being destroyed or altered, or
      causes damage to the aforementioned equipment or
      disturbance in its functioning, shall be judged guilty of
      manufacturing or spreading computer viruses, and
      sentenced to pay fines or to no more than two years of
      imprisonment.

      Hey! Cool! It's not forbidden to HAVE viruses, just as
      long as you only give to them who knows what it is. I
      think i'll start making an lame AV-program, so i can go
      around collectin viruses, and then just say that i was
      against them all from the start and tried to get the new
      stuff by looking like one of them. Hahahah! What a joke!
      No chance that they'll bust someone, except for them who
      spreads the shit. Our magazine IS a virus-magazine, and
      we state that even before you unzip it, so that's not a
      felony either. :))))) Fuck them corrupted suckers!
      ---------------------------------------------------------
  
      (SWITZERLAND's law)
  
      "Anyone, who, without authorization
       - erases, modifies, or destructs
         electronically or similarly saved or data,
         or anyone who,
  
       - creates, promotes, offers, makes available, or circulates in
         any way
         means destined for unauthorized deletion, modification, or
         destruction of such data,
         will, if a complaint is filed, receive the same punishment."
  
         P.S.: same punishment =Jfine or imprisonment for a term of up to
         three years; in cases of a considerable dam-age, five years with
         prosecution ex officio
  
      ---------------------------------------------------------
  
      This is about the same as the Swedish, but not as long
      time in jail as in Sweden etc.
  
      ---------------------------------------------------------
  
  As Frisk said in BULL-210, these laws will make it equal
  to spread poison if your virus trashes anything except
  if it bugs. THIS IS TOTALLY INSANE! What has happened to
  our community? It's lower sentese to kill, run-over, sell
  dope etc. than a little digital prank? Our politicians are
  totally out of their minds as i seems. Oh, well.. If i go
  down, there will always be another. But i'll tell you this
  much, that i will NEVER do time, like 6 years in jail or
  something, and if anyone tries to bust me, s/he'll go down
  with me, and do trust me on thatone.
