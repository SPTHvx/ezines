  Deep corner's disussion about all between heaven and hell..(hm?)..
  ==================================================================
  
  Yeah!, here I'll include yet another of this sweet 'n'crazy article
  comi'n right away from my very own brain! As the subject already
  might have told you, it has really nothing to do with the magazine
  and such things itself. I suggest that you read it anyway, who knows,
  you might share the same thougts as I am. If you do, lucky you, b'cos
  then you must have to be a genius! 
  
  Okey, here we go, I know many people (often the press and non-computer
  people and such lower ranged human beings!, but anyway) who wants to
  know the motivation of writing these "malicious" programs, ie viruses.
  						     
  Motivations? oh, that's a good word!, just as some musicians (specially
  gays!, for example groups like Pet Shop Boys, yuck!) are talking loud
  about inspiration and all kinda weird sources. This "inspiration" made
  them write that song, dedicated to that person, and all this "nice"
  stuffs, how sweat.
  
  Well, it might be so, that the artist with this VERY creative brain
  wrote that song as a dedication to a special girl or something, hm,
  well more boy friends in the case of Pet Shop Boys! They might have
  been that obsessed with this person, and wrote the text just to
  remember this person forever.
  
  Oh, this is sweat!! Forever, infinite, eternal, love. Yeah, *sigh*
  they includes some of my very favourites words!! And I've myself used
  this words, written peoms, songs, and other stuffs to dedicate my
  works, my thoughts, to one special girl. Or well, Maria?, period
  
  So, what am I then trying to say?? Well, this inspiration this 
  obsession, this stuff, can't this just be rubbish?? I mean, in some
  cases (not all!), it must be rubbish, lies and nothing but pure 
  noncense! Some *must* do it in pure greed only. They want to sell
  all kinda things, cd's, books, yes, the list is long., just for the
  money, fame, yes, in some cases it's pure greed only! 
  
  Well, then let's talk about greed. I've made my own citat, but to
  compare it with something other, I took another, quite "equal", but
  in its meaning, very different citat. It comes from an "old" swedish
  virus writer who called himself Tormentor. He wrote this:
  
  "Fame is really your WORST enemy." (Tormentor/DY) 
  
  Well, I surely understand him, I really do. He got lotsa bad publicty
  from all different papers around the country. But that citat, is kinda
  "selfish" (not calling him selfish or anything!), but it just reflex
  the situation on one single person. Myself i am always thinking in big
  scales. Therefor, I can with 100% assurance claim that the following
  citat is true, for all humans living on a planet, called earth. 
   
  "Greed is really your WORST enemy." (The Unforgiven/IR)
  
  Well, it's true, sad but true..Peoples worst enemy is that we can't ever
  be satisfied! We want more and more and more, and if we got *everything*
  we still want to get more! This is sick, this is human's worst enemy!
  
  If a man (human in general!) got everything, everything that money can
  buy ie, "material" things. He still wants more, yes sure, I mean, he
  must also care about our "inside". Sure, but let's then say he got it
  all there too. He got a good whife, he is satisfied with his work, with
  himself, and nearly everthing. Well, then the question is, does this man
  want more? Yes!! I am sure he's always missing something!!
  
  Then what can this man want to have?? Well, you might not guess it, but
  lemme think here, hm, he wants to live forever, he wants to be immortal!
  Yes! sure as hell he wants!, he's enjoying his life, and don't want it
  to end. This is against the human "laws", but he still wants it! Then
  he've heard something about the DNA research, which says that he *can*
  be immortal!! Oh, then it's all clear, this man will live forever, all
  the way into eternity!!
  
  But is he then satisfied?? NO WAY! Now when he's immortal, he can't see
  no limit for his knowledge!, he wants to explore the space, he wants to
  travel in time, he wants it all! (thanks, Queen!). Yes, I couldn't have
  written it better myself (besserwisser!:)), but he wants it all, period 
  
  Yeah, right, there'll always be evil as long as the word greed exists!
  But then again, what am I trying to say?, am I this kinda person?, I
  dunno, we all got demands, we'll need to be satisfied, myself aswell. 
  But then anyway, I remember I wrote some stuff about motivation, and
  inspiration. Yes, they're controlled by our greed. If we had no moti-
  vation, or inspiration we wouldn't have done shits! If it wasn't for
  the human greed, we hadn't done shits! So, we must have some sort of
  greed, but as I told you, human greed can't stop, there's no limit!
  
  Then, you might ask, what's my motivation, my inspiration, and what 
  it the source of my greed? Hm!, this is tough questions, with no really 
  100% true answer! Okey, like I said in the last issue (refering to
  Maria K), "You're my only inspiration, my unlimited source...", well,
  that might be a bit of the truth, but far away from everything! There
  is lotsa more stuff that I wants, even if I don't know it! It's
  somewhere in mine subconsciousness, which tells me my evil demands.
  
  Evil?, interesting word, well, I'd like to say that all demands are 
  evil, so you can't say that I'm a evil one just b'cos I've written
  some viruses. Viruses are harmless, it's the bombs, which may cause
  you trouble. I've now, finally realized that a virus doesn't have to
  carry a bomb, for being "phun". It all depends of its cabability to
  spread out. But then, why am I making bombs, and other naughy things
  in nearly all of my viruses?, I dunno!, promise you! If I had the
  answer that question, I wouldn't have made any futher bombs in my
  common viruses. But I'll most likely include bombs in those too.
  What a shame!..
  
  Anyhow, I'll now quit this article (thanks for reading!!), with one
  last message: "express yourself!". Yeah, right, if it wasn't for
  this magazine, I'd have been an author, a composer, or even a poet,
  not saying that I does this for living or anyway, but still..
