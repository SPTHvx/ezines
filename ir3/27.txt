                  Sweden - A temporary battlefield ?
                  ==================================
  
  Gaak! Sweden has started out to look a bit like a battlefield, atleast
  on the larger cities BBSes, that is. First there was this demo from
  Denmark's PARTY III (Cyboman). When it arrived to our systems it had
  been infected with a resident, polymorphic, .COM infector. Whoever,
  there was no (what-so-ever) stealth, and it "only" infected on execution.
  Some people i know got infected by it, but me & The Unforgiven was out
  of the "infrareds" this time. (puuuh! :))
  
  Then Neuromatica (after their neu-year demo) made a product that, when
  it was resident, looked like itself for the virus, but only faked, and
  beeped every time you ran an infected file. This program hangs a bit if
  you use Windows for workgroups with it. (OK! OK! I don't have Windows,
  so don't rag with me please :)) So after a friend of mine tried it out it
  fucked a bit, but without them Windows stuff it probably works just fine,
  so it's a great thing if you have it on your drive(s). I actually have
  the source-code to it in .ASM format, but i will not include it, since we
  don't wish to start a rag with any other groups.. If you want it, it's
  avalible on almost any decent system with the filename "NEU-WARN.ZIP"
  (textfile, .COM and .ASM in it).
  
  Lateron i saw a message in the Swedish HACKER REPORT meeting that a new
  version of the popular DMP had a trojan inside it, and all them loosers
  started to scream, so i checked it out. I mean like.. shit! The whole
  damn program was a trojan that truncated/deleted C:\*.* and some more
  files, after that it trashed the harddrive, and last but not least there
  was a resident rountine in it.. probably printing a line of text after a
  few minutes, with something like the below.
  
  "KILL DAVID WOLF!"
  "[THM]"
  
  This shows that it was made with the trojan horse maker, by Lord Zero of
  LoC (Logical Coders) here in Sweden. Ok, i don't like trojans since they
  only bring the whole thing down in a few seconds, but for them board-
  crashers it might be something good. I don't know, and i don't care.
  
  It's like a VCL but for trojans instead. All them damage effects found
  in VCL 1.X is included (ofcause more/other things aswell).
  
  This program is avalible as LOCTHM.??? (in original, zip), but as with
  all these, there's always someone that can't stand them. This is what
  has happened in this case too. An "ANTITHM" program's out there.. But
  it may be trojanized/infected aswell, since the .DOC's looks a bit
  strange. Like the name, "FDSOFT", no what-so-ever explanation what it
  stand for or anything like that. Anyhow, you can get this by calling
  your local system and download the file "ANTITHM.???".
  
  This is the only news i got for you right now, but that's enough to scare
  the Swedish lamers to jump and hide behind their SCAN that can't find a
  shit :)
