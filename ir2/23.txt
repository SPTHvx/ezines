                             HOW TO CONTACT US
                             =================

	If you wanna get in contact with us, for some strange reason,
 	this text will give you the answer. Okey, first we haven't
 	managed to get a US-contact-board, but anyway, we might get
 	one in the future. The problem with having a US board is that
 	that we can't reach the states of the simply reason that we
 	can't afford it. It costs us about one US$ / minute, and we're
 	not exactly having lots of cash. So..why don't we phreak our
 	calls then?

	Well..hard to say, first of all, it's rather hard to get a
 	pbx or AT&T cards from here. If you wanna be a card supplier,
 	feel free to contact us right away. If you use (abuse) AT&T
 	often and for a long time, you will probably get busted. I 
	don't know anyone here in Sweden getting busted for using 
	AT&T, but I definitely don't wanna be the first one. If we
 	got busted for some silly AT&T abuse, it would be the end
	for the group. Check the shit that happened with ARVC some
 	month ago, we don't want that to happen..

	Anyway, we used to have some sort of HQ	here in Sweden, 
	more precisely a board called Inner Circle, this awesome
	board (Heil WiCO!), had to close his board of the simple
	reason of he got some dully impuls, that made him go buy
	some new sort of laser video or something like that. He
	sold his computer to some jerk in the hoods, and Inner
 	Circle went down for the second time (Sorry folks, face
 	the reality!)
 
      	He was the first bbs for a very long time that had viruses
	(.exe/.com) for the major public, and the responses was	very
 	good..Almost every user leeched *.* in that area! Hehe..I bet
 	we'll see some more viruses coming from Sweden in the nearest
 	future! 

	But anyway, let us not talk about the past, let's hit for the
	future! We've managed to get a new contact/HQ board, call it
 	what you will.. We'll hang around there anyway. This board is
 	called FireDoom Systems, and it's a kinda cool bbs..It's running
 	under Vision/X, with a quite "OK" underground area..It's placed
 	in the capital city of Sweden (Stockholm), and the number is 
	+46-(0)-8-7184627...Enjoy!
