IR> When did you enter the Computer/PC Scene ?


WICO> Well my first computer was an ABC 80, then i was among the 10
      first person's in Sweden to get the new incredible Vic20 computer!,
      from that i moved along the most old Atari models, Sord M5 (a BIG
      flop!), Vic 64, Amiga, lots of PC models. Well i it was actually
      BamBam/THG, and Metal Gear/INC who talked me into the PC Scene at
      the time around 1989


IR>   Did you those days had any plans at start bbs those days..?


WICO> I was already running an Amiga Board when i entered the PC scene...


IR>   ..and when did you first got into the modem-world ?


WICO>  Heu!, thats a LONG time ago around 83-84 i would guess! 
       i got a POWER FULL 1200bps modem YeH!

IR>    Which groups have you been involved with ?

WICO>  Puh! Well i wont mention the first groups i formed on the c64 time!,
       coz they	was way to lame!, But i started in amiga groups like Aurora
       mainly a Demo trainer group, i was an original supplier for Classic
       (which recently was re-born on the amiga scene!), i was into Scoopex
       (a real legend in the Amiga scene!)... Well when i moved ahead into
       the IBM Scene i started in THG, then RAZOR and INC EUROPE.

IR>    How did you became a site for DY ?

WICO>  Well it just happend!, Tormentor lived in the same town, he had just
       started with virus, so had i, i had opened a virus section on my bbs
       like 1month before i came in contact with Tormentor, and then it 
       just happend somehow!

IR>    Can you tell me a bit how DY was formed ?

WICO>  It was totally formed by Tormentor

IR>    Which position you Wico got at the starting at the group ?

WICO>  Well we didnt assign any special position's, i was just a part of
       DY and i runned our board, and spread our products. We just had a
       great time and enjoyed messing with the Swedish Shareware dudes!

IR>    Why did you (Tormentor) choice the name "Demoralized Youth" ?

WICO>  You gotta have some kind of name!, and DY was a great name for a
       virus group., Why do you call your group Immortal Riot?

IR>    Which members did DY got from the beginning ?

WICO>  Well Tormentor started the hole thing, then more and more of us
       joined in i really can't remeber who joined when and stuff like
       that!

IR>    Which members did DY had ?, and what was your position in DY ?

WICO>  Well! i can't tell, it was a while ago, and all boozing & drugs
       have made my mind real fucked up... and which member we had aint
       that important, what we made is what should be remebered

IR>    How was DY organized ?

WICO>  Where we organized? <grin>

IR>    Is Demoralized Youth still in business, or are you completely
       retired ? 

WICO>  Well i can only talk for myself, and i am still in biz but not
       under Demoralized Youth

IR>    Can you describe the virus scene in sweden ?

WICO>  Dont you know that yourself? haha!!, Well it has been quite lame
       for a while, but it's getting more active again!!! You're the one
       who should descripe this to the readers, you're the one who knows!!

IR>    How do you think DY was compared with the other groups,
       like Phalcon/Skism, NuKE ?

WICO>  If we hadnt quited we would be along the TOP today i think!

IR>    Which virus-group, do you think rule ?

WICO>  my personal opinium would be Phalcom/Skism, Dark Angel is really
       great!

IR>    Who do you think is the perfect virus coder ?

WICO>  A guy without a life, sitting in front of his computer 24/hrs a day,
       without any attentions getting a real girlfriend, he is happy with
       his lovely right hand.

IR>    Which country is the most talent in virus coding ?

WICO>  Boring Question!!!, move a head please

IR>    Which virus-group, are you considering as the most lame ?

WICO>  Well the most lame one's is hard to tell since they are so lame,
       so i even havent heard of them!!!

IR>    Do someone  release anything as 'DY'nowdays ?

WICO>  No!

IR>    What's your oppinion about board-crashers ?

WICO>  If you cant protect your system against 'board crashers' or whatever,
       you deserv to get a lession.

IR>    About PCExpress, 1.00 what do you think about it?

WICO>  Well, quite a nice BackDoor indeed!, i think i Nuked about 15-20
       boards in  a couple of hours!

IR>    What do you think about Mikael Winterkvist?

WICO>  (FOTNOT: About he's buying pirated software)
       HahA!, Well Mikael Winterkvist is a REAL Screw-Up!, i suppose that
       all non-swede's dont know a shit about this melon-head, but he's a
       guy who published lotsa information about Virus Coders/Boards and
       stuff!!, Well he used to buy (c)opyrighted software from me like, 
       3D Studio, Windows NT and such stuff that would take to long time
       downloading from my board!, and he leeched around 200mb of wares
       too!
     
       When he published me and other's as virus spreaders i went to attack
       him, with the information that he bought	(c) software, he then said
       it was to collect evidence of me selling (c) stuff, when i then 
       wondered if he really needed to download over 200mb, and buy (c)
       wares for around 500US$ to get enough evidence, after that he was
       quitet for a while, i had really blown away his image as a 100%
       legal computer owner, who  never would use pirate stuff.

IR>    About Swedish Virus Laboratory, why did it closed?

WICO>  I had a break from the Computing during the last months when his
       board still was active, so i really dont know why he closed. 
       Tormentor is nowdays studing on 'Chalmers Tekniska H”gskola'....

IR>    What do you think about the other scenes comparing to
       the virus scene ? For example Piracy vs Virus 
       or Piracy vs Hacking etc ?

WICO>  It really can't be compared!, but i am getting pleasure from both
       scene's so i wouldnt choose between one of them!

IR>    Have DY ever been in "war" with some other group, or person, 
       or someone else?

WICO>  Depends on what you mean with the word 'war', as a Virus group
       we wanted to Nuke as many as possible! you can call that a DY
       vs Everyone if you  want!

IR>    What do you think about 'rag-wars'between two diffrent groups ?

WICO>  meaningless, we should fight toghter against our enemies!

IR>    What is your oppinion about Anti-Virus Asses, like our own 'Mikael
       Larsson', and well, the bigger ones too, like John Mcafee or Dr
       Alan Salomon ?

WICO>  I understand them, they are making major money on there anti-virus 
       products!, I respect them as smart buissniss person's, i am a busi-
       ness person myself, and all we care about is to make as much money
       as possible! they choosed Anti-Virus i chooses to sell Computers...

IR>    How would you define yourself, when you're looking in the mirror ?

WICO>  That's not up to me to judge, but my girlfriend think's i am the
       sexiest man on the planet, i have never got any problem getting a
       chick, they just seem's to fall for me at the first sight!! You
       know, Swedish, Blond, Blue eye's, Going on gym 3-4times a week.... 

IR>    So, why are you a pervert ?

WICO>  I'm a PERVERT?, Hue! - i just luve to pop the cherry of young lovely
       girls! But if you think i am a Pervert you should see my girlfriend!
       She's the most sex-fanatic person i ever has meet!!!! She even 
       make's me exhausted!!!!!

IR>    Have you ever got hurt in your ears by a bitch screaming loud ?

WICO>  Nah! if they start screaming too much i put my dick into her mouth
