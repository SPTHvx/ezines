	          ABOUT THE INSANE REALITY
		  ========================

    This is the second issue of Insane Reality coming from 
    Immortal Riot. The magazine name "Insane Reality" is
    a quit good name of a magazine, and so is the mag :)
    This magazine is ment to be spread to all of the under-
    ground, and to people who're enjoying viruses, and that 
    sort of stuff..I really hope you enjoy this magazine,
    cuz we've spend quit a hard time finish it. We're
    really no 30-men crew, and since you don't can ask anyone
    if they wanna contribute some stuffs for a virus-magazine
    we'd to make all by our self. So, enjoy this magazie or go
    die..<grin>. Nah!..not really, but now, I've something
    important to say to you before I continue. The one who can
    not deal with viruses, who just wanna abuse the power of
    ‚m, please stop reading this magazine right away! We don't 
    want people to abuse this as some fucking AT&T <..hehe..>
    The reason of releasing this one, is..HMM..I don't really
    know hehe..that's true!..Well, for having phun I guess?
    Hehe..or just piss some ass off ehe ?..well, who knows?

    Anyway, it's been a while since the first issue was
    released (..07-29-1993..) and lots of things has happend
    in the group since that time...For example, we have got 
    a new member, so now we're three members in the group.
    We have also had the pleasure to know a guy who helps
    us with some VGA'S. We've got a contact board, I've 
    started mutating viruses and Metal Militia have started
    along with doing some viruses out from scratch. So, many
    news have happend with us, so read all of our articles,
    and spread this magazine around as much you can. I know
    this ain't no 40HEX magazine or something like that, but
    this is atleast a try to make a good (?) virus magazine,
    and I hope we can continue doing our magazine without
    being disturbed too much..After our first issue had
    been released we saw some messages about people wondering
    who we really were..and to the crowd, I can tell ya,
    that you don't really need to know about us, that's 
    un-important huh?.. Anyway..this was suppost to be
    a text about the magazine..well, think this is enough!
