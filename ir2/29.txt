                         IR FOR THE FUTURE
                         =================
   
   This text will tell you a bit about our future plans..But, since I
   don't know anything about it, this will be a short one, right huh?
   As we told you, the second issue was released (you're in it right
   now), but how about the third one?..Well, let's put it this way,
   I'm kinda tired of doing _LOTS_ of shitty work! I've written a
   bunch of stupid article, drawn many VGA'S, Hacked some viruses, and
   asked for some stupid interviews from other groups/persons. Don't
   get me wrong, but this is just too much.

   We haven't got ANY support at all from any other group, like, it
   would be MUCH more easy to put out a magazine, if we were more
   people, (Okey, The Sarge helped us out with some vga's), but some
   help from other art groups like iCE/ACiD wouldn't be that bad. Okey,
   then you might ask why we must include such things as vga/interviews/
   articles, and that shit..Well..since we ain't that good in just virus
   coding, we must have something that 40HEX don't..

   It isn't just a good waste of time to release a mag which got vga-
   pictures and so on..People are enjoying great art! And some people
   have vga's in demand for just download the magazine. So..I don't
   really know (as you might notice), anything about the future, we'll
   probably continue doing viruses. But the mag, hmm..it's a waste of
   K/bytes to release a magazine if it just got viruses included. Then
   they'll probably just save the "virus-article" into a file, and read
   it from their favorite text-editor, right huh? And releasing a
   magazine with vga's/articles/etc../etc..takes time, and I don't got
   any time left..

   If you wanna help us out in any way, feel free to do that! For
   example, if you are good in art, send us a vga/ansi logo which we'll
   include, if you wanna include an article about the virus-scene, do
   that! If you wanna get your latest (or old) source code spread, give
   it to us! Anyone can help us out in any way! And if you are a pretty
   well-known person in the underground scene, why don't you contact
   us, and we might interview you or something. If you wanna do some
   bbs-advertising.. No problems! We're pleased to have any material
   at all! Anyway, what more can I tell you about the future with
   Immortal Riot, when I don't know a shit myself :)?..Anyhow..catch
   ya later!
