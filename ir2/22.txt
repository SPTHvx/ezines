                     RESPONSES SINCE ISSUE#1
                     =======================

	This text will deal with what people said about the
	first issue. I have asked around a little bit among
	them who're dealing with the underground/piracy scene.
	If you don't got the first one yet, I suggest that
	you get it right away! Cuz if you ain't, you certainly
	have missed something in the virus history ;) hihi..nah,
	kidding actually!..Anyway, go grab it on some board
	around you (?), or well	give a call to some Swedish
	Elite-board, for example FireDoom Systems.

	Since nobody, and I really mean NOBODY knew that we were
	doing a disk-mag, they couldn't have any suggestions at 
	all, and we just released the first issue when nobody
	knew there was a group called Immortal Riot. Now, some
	folks knows about us, and I've seen many questions about
	for example, who are Immortal Riot? What other handles do
	they use? Have they called themself something else before?
	Where do they live? etc etc..

	So, now I think some people know about us, and what we're
	doing. When I asked what they thought about the first 
	issue the repondence was quit ok, but it could be far
	better if we did so, and if we did that, included more of
	that etc etc..

	Many people wanted to have interviews with other people
	around, more VGA/ANSi, original MODules, Hacking/Phreaking
	support, AT&T lists, Anarchy texts and a complete under-
	ground issue. This would just became a complete mess, we
	can't do a phreak-magazine better than PHRACK. If some-
	one wanna get _ALL_ Phreaking/Hacking news, why	don't you
	just download the latest phrack. Well, then you might ask
	why we're doing a virus-mag, when there's 40HEX out there?
	Well..ofcause we can't beat up the great 40HEX from Phalcon/
	Skism..

	40HEX is the best thing ever happened to the virus scene
	since DAv was in business. But what I think about that is
	that everybody can't get 40HEX, for example nearly no one
	here in Sweden got the 9-11 40HEX, they	do got the 1-8 but
	that they were released when DY, and Tormentor was around.
	The magazine (or info journals,	released from NUKE, has
	never reached Sweden, we got the first two ones, but after
	heard that there is seven (eh?) information-journals out
	there, I got rather confused! Why ain't Sweden got no virus-
	scene? I saw the Evolution magazine from YAM some while ago,
	but they have probably released MUCH more than ONE! I know
	that a second issue was being released some _WHILE_ ago..
	But haven't find it somewhere in Sweden. I know this really
	sux! We ain't got anything about the virus-news here! We
	only got ONE board supporting real viruses. So, we're trying
	to push Sweden a bit more into the Virus-Scene. With some
	help from ANOI, we might even succed! Well, anyhow, back to
	the responses of the mag now..

	They also wanted a VGA-based MAGazine, with an own music
	system! Gaa..give me a break! I thought	vga-based mag would
	be a cool thing, but after I thought it over..humm..nah!
	That would only be a waste of time! And starting coding a own
	music system for playing a lousy .MOD would be very stupid!
	Think it over! A virus-MAG with	a nice smooth-vga-scrolling
	shit..Nah, let the demo	people deal with that! We'll not do
	a vga-magazine,	with a own-music system, we'll probably not
	make own MODs, we'll not include P/H/A articles, neither
	stupid lists of AT&T cards! If we gets a hole list of AT&T
	credit cards, why should we pass ‚m over to all fucking traders
 	around,	who gets this magazine first?..

	The common magazines will be very similar to this one, some
	viruses/vga-pictures/articles and it might even be some inter-
	views, but that's all! We're just three people working with
	this..and we'll NOT! take in one more for just making a simple
	.MOD for every issue...Anyway, if you have some good suggestions
	about how we could do our magazine better, feel free do contact
	us about that. If you wanna include some of your viruses (.asm/
	.exe or something else), no problems! We take in whatever you
	might think of! If you have written an article about the virus-
	scene, and wants it spread, just upload it to us..So, just
	because I didn't made that mag looking exactly as some people
	told me too, don't be afraid to give me more ideas!..
