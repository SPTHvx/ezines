   		      SCAN REPORTS FROM ISSUE #1
   		      ==========================
   
   This text will be about the Mcafee Scan. Everybody who've changed
   on a virus a bit just to fool his scan, knows that he gets kinda
   pissed of on you! And when he don't know who you're he can't get
   his revenge. So, the question is how he gets his revenge? Well, 
   we (Metal Militia), mutated 6 viruses, which purpose was just 
   to be "renaissanced". He succeded in fool Scan (v106 which was
   the latest one then, and Dr Alan Salomons FindViru 6.20).
   
   Then we released completely source codes to all the viruses in the
   first issue, which was very well spread in countries as Sweden/
   Usa/Netherlands/etc/etc..So, we can suppose that many people 
   actually have some virus sources now, and hopefully will people
   continue spread/mutatate/hack the sources we included in the first
   issue of Insane Reality.
   
   I really don't think he likes all hacks or mutated viruses of the
   simple reasons that they often cause just as much damage as completely
   new ones (If the virus then have pretty similar effects). The different
   between a hack and a brand new virus, is that the new one takes much 
   more time to finish, and not that many are cabable to code it. Then 
   anyhow, he released his scanv107 about 3-4 weeks after we released our
   first issue, and guess what?..A new "string" for our mutations had
   been added, and well, I suppose he can't use our "own" mutations names 
   in his "virlist", but %œ?!, what a bore he really is! I'll give you
   some	examples...We (or well me then:)) "labeled" the mutations after
   six very good Metallica texts, and well, here is what they were called..
   
   And justice for all, Misery, Fade to black, Fight fire with Fire,     
   Senseless destructions, and The thing that should not be.
   
   Then little John found the most boring mutation names I've ever
   heard, the "mutations" became Leprosy 564 [OW], Bad Brains 2 [OW],
   7th Son 473 [7SON], Creeperc [CreepC], and Bad Boy 3 [BB3].
   
   I know you can't get your "own" virus name because you just mutate
   a virus, but Hey!, that's not my demand! I want some "colored" names,
   for example Leprosy [IR1] or something like that, but well, you can't
   get it all, can you? Note!, his scan v107 did "just" find five of
   our six mutations, he forgot to add the 808 mutation called 
   "...justice for all" in his v107 and v108!!. I don't know why, I know
   that the virus works, and if someone (ab)use it, it might cause some
   trouble..Really hopes so...John will regret what he often forgets.
   
   So, now in this issue, some (or huh?) "new" (scratch) viruses are
   included, The first is just a non-resident overwriting virus,
   but if his fucking scanner finds it later as some "MINI-300" or 
   similar, I'll just kill him! All overwriting viruses are pretty
   similar eachother, but well, I rather would like to call the 
   "copying" overwriting viruses to C-OW:ing ones (Copying Overwriting
    ones), anyone who agree with me?
   
   Metal's non-overwriting RES/COM and RES/COM/EXE is now finished to.
   And then I don't want to see some "untrue" names on them. The
   viruses are called EXTASY! and RAVAGE!, and if he labels them 
   to some fucking mutation name, he'll fucking die..Metal got _SOO_
   many viruses under production, so I don't really know a shit what
   he's doing right now (sounds strange eh?). Our last mutations was
   just a few bytes code-changing, but what if the whole infect-routine,
   encrypt/decrypt/install/etc routine are changed, you've just kept
   some others routine, for example (sounds strange this but anyway),
   if you have "stolen" the infect routine (non-overwriting stuff),
   from one virus, the encrypt/decrypt routine from one, the install
   to memory from one, and the "infect identification" from one?..
   What will the AV-poeple then do?..Huh?..Say that it's some sort
   of hack virus from A,B,C,D and E virus?..nah!..that don't work!
   Someone tell me! I don't know?? Will be some "new" virus, right?
   
   Anyway..If you reads this John..Enjoy! Then the magazine is very
   well spread around. And that's exactly what we wants! So..get
   around names right (I've spend some time figuring some "nice"
   names out), and I really hate time wasting! Thats's all..
