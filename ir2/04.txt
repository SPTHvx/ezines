	This magazine may contain stuffs of different things,
	which can be abused, for example the virus source codes
	included. If some of you use the viruses for the know-
	how of writing viruses, great! But if you just compile
	the viruses included and spread them around, so they
	cause any damage to private persons, business or
	goverment, we can under no circumstances be held 
	responsible for your action. It's not illegal in our
	country to write or modify viruses, so if someone comp-
	lains about us..up your ass! If the magazine itself
	has been modified, such as virus-infected, we can not be
	held responsible for any damage it may cause with you
	or your computer. This means..that you're reading at 
	your own risk..Okey..I think you get it huh? Yeah,
	If you don't just exit reading right away..that's it!
