             Interview with MR.X / HSI                            
	     =========================

IR>   What is HSi all about?



MR.X> Well, i can not really tell you to much about what HSi are all
      about, thou this would probbly ruin alot of operations. One thing
      i can tell you is that we deal with alot of fun things as Contract
      Nukes and Contract Hacks. We really don't care what we have to do,
      it's only a matter of money. Ones upon a time, there was a guy that
      wanted us to do some nasty things with a network called Cancernet,
      We took the money the guy offered us and burned it infront of him. 
      (we are not animals.. Even if sixpack is pretty close.. :-)



IR>   How did HSi start?


 
SiXPACK> Yeah, Mr.X and Lloyd started the group, but Lloyd suxed
         real bad, so we kicked him out when I joined in! 


MR.X> Well, let me put it like this, LLoyd was a rather cool guy in the
      begining, but the money made him find out what the word "greed",
      really stod for. He tricked many of my friends with false 
      information and made alot of guys, very angry. It would have been
      a bad thing to keep him in the group, so we closed his account and
      changed all the passwords and in-dials to the HSi-Network.  
 
IR>   When did you enter the Computer Scene ?


MR.X> This makes me remember the golden years of my old ZX80. 
      The memory banks were limited to one kilobyte, but that did
      not stop me from spending day and night infront of the computer.
      If i'am correct the date i first unpacked my first computer, would
      be somewere around 1980. That makes 13 years of struggle to get to
      the top :-) Hi, Sammy, Pete + all the rest in the former SCCS.
 
IR    Did you those days had any plans at all at start
      a bbs those days..?

MR.X> I've allways dreamt of the perfect BBS, but in the 80's the speeds
      and hardwares were to slow to fit my demands :-)
 
IR>   ..and when did you first got into the modem-world ?

MR.X> I've been ONLINE since 1989, if you would add up all my privious
      phonebills you would get enough money to pay the full price of a
      Cray-1. In the begining i paid for all my calls, i learned the
      hard way that you can not keep on calling forever if you gotta
      pay the fucking bill. Sometimes when the bill arrived i had to
      sell some snow, inorder to get the money. This will make you
      understand that my phonebills were HUGE. I were (and still are)
      operating on a non-digital line and even the scanning costs me
      money :-(
 
IR>   Which groups have you been involved with ?

MR.X> In the first years of my computer madness i were a member of the
      TCB (the code brothers). I went on the the SCCS, when the C-64
      arrived to our PO.BOX!! I stayed there until 1989.
      I spent two years on my own, reading everything there was to read
      about H/P/V. The year was now 1991 and i saw a huge
      light in the sky and heard the drunk sailer say Mystery seems to
      be a cool bounch and they bought you a couple of beers at the
      FP-TRIP to denmark... Hi Wayrah, Jian and all the rest.
      Jian got himself a huge phonebill and the group lost him, to the
      streets :-) I went back to my studies... In 1992, me and Lloyd formed
      HSi. The rest is history...
 
IR>   When did you started to Phreak & Hack ?

MR.X> I started in 1989, so that makes it 4 years today :-)
 
IR>   How was HSi formed, and by who ?

IR>   HSi were formed by me and LLoyd in 1992. I called him up and said 
      that we should gather our forces and make the world trumle of fear
      :-)

      take a look at the text below, it was sent out to alot of big

  COMPUTER WHILE WE ARE HACKING FOR YOU!

IR>   HOW CAN YOU CONNTACT HADES?


MR.X> YOU WONT REACH US, WE WILL CONTACT YOU...

 
IR>   Which position did you got at the start in the group ?

Mr.X> Number one, what else could i be? I were born as a leader :-)
 
IR>   Why did you (and the others) choose the name "Hades International"?

MR.X> I came up with the name, the others had nothing to do with it.
      HACKERS IN DEEP SHIT sounded like a good name :-) And we are
      in trubble with the FEDS so that makes us International right?
 
IR>   Which members did HSi had from the beginning ?

MR.X> Well, in the begining it were just me and LLoyd.
 
IR>   Any added or removed members since then ?

MR.X> Yes, we add and remove alot. One of our policys are to not make a
      offcial memberlist. A normal HSi member does only know the name of
      two other HSi employers and he has the phonenumber to one of them.
      We must operate in this form to make things safe. If i would list
      all the members right now, there would be some heavy shit falling
      down on'em. If you wonder if a certain guy is a member, just ask me,
      if you know my number.
 
IR>   What's your "help" to the scene ?

MR.X> Help? We ain't doin' anything for free :-) We spend many hours
      on research that helps the moderate phreak to get the latest
      information about security problems and movments within the
      fedral screw-ups.
 
IR>   I've heard something about a virus division, in HSi is this true ?

MR.X> Yes, we do have a Virus and Trojan section in HSi. If this
      interwiew would be held within a certain range of phreaks,
      i might would have told you something more about that. Our
      programming staff develops customiszed Trojans and Viruses
      for all systems that we need to gather information from.
      My board (Room 212) will reopen in one month on a new number
      with 3 nodes-ringdown and the best selection of HSi viruses
      and trojans. There will also be a wide selection of other
      viruses and trojans online. We prommise you 1.44 GIGABYTES
      of PURE H/P/V. If you belive that you are the best, you'll
      get a personal invitation. :-)
 
IR>   What do you think about HSi comparing to other Hacking groups ?
      For example SHA ?

MR.X> I could not be the judge of that. SHA are not to be called
      a hacker group, i would prefer to call them a informer group,
      if you catch my drift.
 
IR>   Which Hacking Group are you considering as the best nowdays ?

MR.X> Well, there are many H/P groups out there, some of them deal
      only with system 75's and some of them deal with everything
      they can get their hands on. The best H/P group out there is
      and will allways be R.O.T (Hi Lord.IBM).
 
IR>   Can you name some organisations/people you have hacked ?

MR.X> I can not make a list of them. That would ruin my future as
      a military system operator :-)  (46-31-160342) :-)
 
IR>   How do you think of yourselfs on a scale between 1-10 ?

MR.X> I can not rank myself, that would be like telling everyone that
      my EGO is the best since the great swedish vikings :-)
 
IR>   Do you have any sites contacts abroad ?
      .. and do you have any "big" contacts abroad ?
      .. and Hacked MailBoxes or phone-conf PBX's ?

MR.X> Sure we do. Contact Sixpack if you want the NUP's and numbers...
      Big Contacts??? Does At&T operators and Fedral-fuck-ups count?
      :-) We do love VMB's and 700- Pbx's :-)
 
IR>   Name some things that you have released as HSi ?

MR.X> Phreak School, Fuck the AT&T, Scanlist, Offcial Warnings and
      lotsa more... All those files will be avilible at the new
      Room 212.
 
IR>   Have you ever had any trouble with the cops and why ?

MR.X> Trubble, that is my middlemame. I've got no truble with the
      Swedish Cops (they are so damn corrupted anyway :-) But
      i can make the list of dudes that wants my ass very long,
      The FEDS would like to boil my ass and that is a fact.
 
IR>   Have you ever been in war with any other group(s) ?

MR.X> We don't belive in wars. The H/P world must remain friends.
 
IR>   Who do you think is the best hacker alive today ?
      .. and the best phreaker alive today ?

MR.X> As i said before a hacker or a phreak can not be the best of
      everything. He can be the best of something in the spectrum
      of hacking or phreaking but not everything. There are alot of
      skilled hackers and phreaks out there. They all belong to groups
      like R.O.T and HSi. 
 
IR>   Which ways of phreaking are the most risky nowadays ?

MR.X> Everything is risky if you don't know how to handle it :-)
 
IR>   Tell us a bit about the T.PHRAUD bust some while ago ?
      (Note!) changed his name into the right one, huh?)..

MR.X> Hihihihi you spelled his name wrong. But you'll have to deal with
      his anger and not me :-) I had dinner with him 7 days before he got
      busted for abusing DATAPAK. I told him (and he knew himself) that
      the Swedish Telecom knew about him. Still, he said "I don't care..."
      Look what happend :-) Cu around Ted .
 
IR>   You turned down your bbs (Room 212) becuz of that eh ? why?

MR.X> Our dear friend TED had a auto-logon script to my board and alot
      of captures. I did not like the risk of being brought to justice.
 
IR>   What's your oppinion about board-crashers ?
      .. and about all BBS systems with backdoors ?
      .. and about Laric / PCE 1.00 Author, (full of B-Doors!!)

MR.X> I really don't mind them. Infact i love them. Hi Wico :-)
      Backdoors are great, they make the world spin around...
      AND LARIC are my favorite backdoor maker, :-)
 
IR>   Have you ever made a board close ? and which & why ?

MR.X> atdt 01146www31160342 Hack, hack, anyone there :-)
 
IR>   What's your defination of a Mega-Lamer ?

MR.X> A 14 years old trader from Stockholm, Sweden.
 
IR>   Which H/Group are you considering as the most lame ?

MR.X> I don't bother to remember the name of lame H/P groups :-)
 
IR>   What do you think about other scenes comparing
      to the H & P scenes ? (Piracy vs. Hacking,
      Piracy vs. Phreaking and so on ?)

MR.X> You could not compare The H/P scene with any other scene. I dislike
      piracy and say the famous words "Viruses to the pepole!".
 
IR>   Why do you love to Phreak/Hack ?

Mr.X> It keeps my brain BUSY... Ring, BUSY!... Redial :-)
 
IR>   Your best H/P memories ?

MR.X>

This is the main-menu that you will see, after that the correct password
is enterd. We used a Root account. 

"?" will display the main menu again. "TOP" will display the main menu from
all the sub directorys.

"Who" will tell us if there is anyone ONLINE. Very usefull to know if the 
Root account is active.

"Passwd" will change your password <--- Pretty logical eh?

"Write" will send a message to any node. "Hey Root, sorry about deleting
the entire system..."

"Shutdown" Does what is sounds like. It shuts down the entire system.

The rest of the command set is rather boring to explain...

This system is kinda dumb. You can do alot of things, like turning of

preform on this system. The Dialout is just great...

IR>   Something you wanna tell the crowd, but never have got any
      oppertunity to say ? ..Say it now !

MR.X> The last thing i wanna tell you is to take care. We would not like
      to read about any more at&t busts and you can avoid to get busted
      if you are carefull. The phreaks of today does not stay in business
      for a long time. They get busted. Don't become greedy, that is my
      final advice. And remember that a wonderfull thing will happen on
      Oktober the 16teen...
