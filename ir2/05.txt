             HELP FOR MOVING AROUND IN THE MAGAZINE
             ======================================

        This issue works pretty much like the last issue
        with a few exceptions. The article viewer has
        some new functions and the mouse support is extended.
        
        To move around in the menues just use the arrow keys
        or the mouse and press enter or the left mouse button
        to make a selection. You can also use the highlighted
        shortcut keys to make your selection.
        
        There are two new improved functions in the article
        viewer (Except for a new great look!). Copying articles
        to files and printing articles. To use these functions
        just press the F1 or F2 key. To exit the viewer press
        ESC, enter or the right mouse button. To scroll
        around in the articles use the up/down arrow to scroll
        one step or PgUp/PgDn to scroll a whole page. You
        can also press and drag the mouse on the scroller bar.
        
        When watching an VGA picture just press ESC or any
        mouse button to return to the menu.

	If you still don't understand how to move around in
        the magazine, I suggest that you go grab some extra
	IQ, or do something drastical! Go buy a Macintosh!
