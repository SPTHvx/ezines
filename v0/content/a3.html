See viruses W32.nova / W32.juli / W32.dnl12 / W32.dread in VX Heavens for code examples.
You can also read Virus Bulletin november 2010 issue for a detailed analysis of the viruses.  "Deelaed Learning" by Peter Ferrie.


Time things
I found this technique a quite long time ago.   This import mechanism has been
available for more than 10 years!   I  took some time before even think to use
it for an entrypoint obscuring virus.

This import mechanism uses different  table  format that is not handled by the
loader, so it is not binded  when  application  is loaded.    Instead  when an
external function is required:    DLL is loaded, function pointer is retrieved
by the use of some special code.   This mechanism  saves time when loading and
also saves  memory  (only  if  DLL  was  not  loaded  before -  then  using of
LoadLibraryA would return the base and no load occurs).


DLIT
Members and sizes:

     Attributes     DWORD
     DLL name       DWORD
     DLL base       DWORD
     Delay  IAT     DWORD
     Bound  IAT     DWORD
     Unload IT      DWORD
     Time Stamp     DWORD


Attributes is stated to be zero by PECOFF v8 documentation. However, that value sometimes is not zero.
DLL name: pointer to DLL's name string.
DLL base: pointer to where DLL's base address of the DLL is saved.
Delay IAT: pointer to list of VAs.  VAs point to code for load the function.
Bound IAT: pointer to list of API addresses.  This works if Time Stamp matches DLL's TimeDateStamp in FileHeader.  A file can contain BIAT but if Time Stamp is null then it is discarded.
Unload IT: It is an exact copy of the Delay IAT before any modification.


Different Mechanisms
Delay IAT is perhaps the simpliest.   When the application requires an API, it
calls corresponding function for load listed in the Delay IAT, then pointer is
replaced  by  API address  (similar to Import Table:  the Import Address Table
must be equal to Import Lookup Table.  The pointer in the IAT  (either pointer
to API  name string or ordinal) is replaced by API function address)

Bound IAT works only if  Time Stamp  matches DLL's FileHeader TimeStamp value.

Unload  IAT is a copy  of the Delay IAT.  There is a function when called will
replace the Delay IAT's contents using the Unload IAT contents.
