BTX encryption

BTS
Bit Test and Set
This instruction test in bit base: the bit specified by offset.  Carry flag is
set according to test, if bit was 0 then CF = 0 else CF = 1.   The bit is then
set to 1.    This means that we can use BTS to set every bit individually from
each virus value.  You can use it to set random bit to complete a bit string:


V-value 1 byte bit string:
             11101111

V-value 1 byte bit string "encrypted" value:

             10101010


So we know that we must set bit at offset 6, 4, 2, 0 in DWORD BTS:

        bts     dword ptr [bitbase], offset


You could also use  full of zero so that there are no virus values, only large 
amount of BTS instructions.


BTR
Bit Test and Reset
This instruction test in bit base: the bit specified by offset.  Carry flag is
set according to test, if bit was 0 then CF = 0 else CF = 1.   The bit is then
set to 0.  This means that we can use BTR to unset every bit individually from
each virus value.  A long full of 1 (then the "encrypted" would look like FFFF
FFFFF ;) ) could be used.  Or an unset schema like BTS.


BTC
Bit Test and Complement
This instruction test in bit base: the bit specified by offset.  Carry flag is
set according to test, if bit was 0 then CF = 0 else CF = 1.   The bit is then
complemented.   A complement is NOT on the bit, so if bit is 0 then it will be
set to 1 or if bit was 1 it will be set to zero.  So, this is like having both
BTS and BTR in one instruction!     This means your virus can take the unusual
shape of:

             FFFFFFFF
             00000000
             FFFFFFFF
             FFFF0000
             FFFFFFFF
             0000FFFF
             00FF00FF

or
             FFFFFFFF
             00000000
             FFFF1ED6
             FFFF0000
             FFFFFFFF
             67DB6F7A
             00FF00FF

Registers Initialisation
The problem with most decryptors outhere  is that they use too many registers,
this technique only needs 1 register if not ESP.    The register points to the
memory address where the virus will be decrypted.  A  register can be also set
using BTS/BTR/BTC, but we must know the content of the register  before  using
the instructions  or it will be transformed to a random value, a  crash  might
happen if we touch invalid memory.

If we use BTS - and BTR to obfuscate - we can set any register in this way:

(bit offset values are decimal)

        xor     eax, eax
        btr     eax, 21
        bts     eax, 22
        btr     eax, 23
        bts     eax, 14
        btr     eax, 13
        bts     eax, 12
        btr     eax, 11

EAX is now 00405000

If we use BTC - and BTR to obfuscate - we can set any register in this way:

(bit offset values are decimal)

        or      eax, -1
        btc     eax, 31
        btr     eax, 30
        btr     eax, 29
        btc     eax, 28
        btr     eax, 27
        btr     eax, 26
        btr     eax, 25
        btc     eax, 24
        btr     eax, 23
        btr     eax, 21
        btc     eax, 20
        btr     eax, 19
        btc     eax, 18
        btr     eax, 17
        btc     eax, 16
        btr     eax, 15
        btc     eax, 13
        btr     eax, 11
        btr     eax, 10
        btc     eax, 9
        btc     eax, 8
        btr     eax, 7
        btc     eax, 6
        btr     eax, 5
        btc     eax, 4
        btr     eax, 3
        btr     eax, 2
        btr     eax, 1
        btc     eax, 0

EAX is now 00405000

Another way to get the address is using CALL+POP, so we can support ASLR, too.
Using the stack is another option if push every "encrypted" value.   ESP would
be bit base and thus no register is initialised.

For more  obfuscation  on the bits we want to set, we can  use  larger offset.
How?  Very simple, using larger offset is just like using 0 to 31, but we must
be careful: for instance, if bts 31 sets 00000000 to 80000000 then with larger
offset we use bts 31 + 32.  From now on, we go from 1 to 32 using 31 as base.

(bit offset values are decimal)

        xor     eax, eax
        bts     eax, 32 + 22
        bts     eax, 32 + 14
        bts     eax, 32 + 12
